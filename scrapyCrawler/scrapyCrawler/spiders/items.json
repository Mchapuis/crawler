We are enhancing our support to provide resources that are diverse, preventive and patient-centred. We are grateful to the Rossy Foundation for providing a critical investment to help us address these challenges.\u201d\nConcordia\u2019s made-to-measure solution\nGaya Arasaratnam, director of Concordia's Campus Wellness and Support Services\nConcordia\u2019s Embedded Wellness Advisor Program will innovate on the drop-in centre concept by offering a wide range of providers and mental health allies across two campuses.\n\u201cWe look forward to offering students the opportunity to meet service providers and trained peers whom they feel comfortable approaching \u2014 directly in their campus environment where they feel most at home,\u201d says Gaya Arasaratnam, director of Concordia's Campus Wellness and Support Services.\nThe Embedded Wellness Advisor Program builds on successful pilot projects within Concordia\u2019s student residences as well as the Aboriginal Student Resource Centre. These pilots demonstrated that approachability makes a crucial difference to those who need care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for students to delay turning to health and counselling services until their distress has become particularly acute,\u201d says Arasaratnam. \u201cThanks to this support from the Rossy Foundation, we hope to reach students in need earlier to provide the right care at the right time and at the right place.\u201d\n\u2018The extra mile in preventive health\u2019\nThe Rossy Foundation, a Montreal-based private foundation, is a leader in funding initiatives in cancer care, mental health, civic engagement, education and the arts. The organization has publicly called on Canada\u2019s universities and others in the philanthropic sector to partner to improve mental health services for students.\n\u201cWe are pleased to support Concordia\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop and innovate programming that thoughtfully responds to students\u2019 mental health needs,\u201d says Stephanie Rossy, Vice-Chair of the Rossy Foundation. \u201cWe believe the Embedded Wellness Advisor Program reflects an approach that goes the extra mile in providing more preventive and patient-centred service.\u201d\nThe Rossy Foundation\u2019s contribution is its second major gift to Concordia.

Yet his career path soon took a sharp turn when he decided to enrol in the MBA program. \u201cSomeone told me I\u2019d make more money by going into business,\u201d he recalls.\nIt was during his MBA studies that Kerklaan made a decision that not only got him noticed but would eventually lead to a momentous job offer: he ran for student office.\n\u201cA few students encouraged me to get more involved in the program, so I became president of the MBA Students Association in my second year,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a big turning point for me because I was a relatively quiet, shy person, and that got me involved in politics and interacting with students and professors. It also gave me a much better understanding of how the university worked.\u201d\nEnter Jim Beckerleg, MBA 76, who was a year ahead of Kerklaan in the program. He had recently graduated and was now working for Commerce Capital Trust. \u201cJim was looking for somebody to run their money market desk, and so he asked about Rudy Kerklaan because he remembered that I had been president of the students association at Concordia,\u201d Kerklaan recalls.\n\u201cI ended up having an interview with him and his boss, Larry Lunn. My career started in Montreal. Then I came out to Vancouver and helped start Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management.\u201d\nKerklaan maintains that it was his involvement in the MBA program that launched him. \u201cI tell people you\u2019ve got to be a bit lucky, but also you\u2019ve got to place yourself to be in a lucky position,\u201d he says.\nLater in his career, Kerklaan became engaged with the United Way. He\u2019s now giving back to his alma mater as a volunteer West Coast co-chair of the Campaign for Concordia: Next-Gen. Now . \u201cI feel that this university project is just as important, and I\u2019m willing to give some time and effort to get people to donate,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI feel that Concordia is on the cusp of introducing some new initiatives in terms of education and maybe changing the way we\u2019re teaching kids to learn through university.

My mother was a housewife who never finished high school. She married very young, and she felt it was extremely important for me and my sister to be in charge of our own destinies. My father was a great person and he encouraged us to pursue higher education, but it was even more important to my mother, especially regarding her daughters.\nI knew from a young age that higher education would be the key to my success and was fortunate to have the opportunity to pursue my ambitions.\nHow did you come to Concordia?\nGC: I left Iran in 1979. I had $2,000 in my pocket when I arrived in Canada\u2026 but tuition was $4,000. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. Where was I going to get the money? My brother was doing his bachelor\u2019s degree at Concordia and he convinced me to meet with one of his professors, Cedric Marsh. Professor Marsh and I spoke for an hour, and at the end he said, \u201cI really want you to join Concordia. Why would you go any other place?\u201d\nHe gave me financial support immediately. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if he hadn\u2019t \u2014 he changed my life, and so did Concordia.\nGina Cody and Cedric Marsh at her PhD convocation in 1989.\nWhat is your advice for future engineers?\nGC: To succeed, you have to persevere. Hard work is required, but there is nothing that you cannot achieve once you make up your mind to pursue it \u2014 no matter the colour of your skin or your gender. My gift to Concordia is for the next generation, so that more people can succeed like I did.\nGina Cody in her school days at Concordia\n\u201cHaving a role model as the face of our faculty will inspire people who wouldn\u2019t even have considered engineering or computer science to give it a try.\u201d\n\u2014 Hannah Halcro, undergraduate student and president of Space Concordia\nThank you for helping Concordia lead\u00a0as a next-generation university!\n"},

If we help enhance Concordia, we can help advance what she believed in.\u201d\nOn October 9, the Doggone Foundation announced it was giving $200,000 towards the Campaign for Concordia: Next-Gen. Now .\nThe gift will support the Elspeth McConnell Fine Arts Award , which will annually provide $5,000 to 18 Faculty of Fine Arts students to undertake internships in non-profit organizations.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Doggone Foundation for its support,\u201d says Concordia President Alan Shepard. \u201cThese opportunities advance our strategic direction to Get Your Hands Dirty . The Doggone Foundation is providing our students with opportunities for experiential learning to become highly engaged citizens of Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the world.\u201d\nThe Elspeth McConnell Fine Arts Award will be granted in all nine fine arts departments. Students who apply will be encouraged to come up with an internship project and approach a non-profit art organization of their choice. The goal of these awards is to allow students to gain on-the-job experience.\nInternships can take place at museums, cultural festivals, exhibition spaces, community theatres, performing arts groups, artist-run centres, co-ops, libraries, schools, art therapy sites or other non-profit arts organizations and projects.\nThe late Elspeth McConnell established the Montreal-based Doggone Foundation in 2012.\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with the Doggone Foundation,\u201d says Rebecca Duclos, dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts. \u201cWe share a vision that students should be active in our community \u2014 making things happen that matter \u2014 and we are thankful the foundation will fund student internships that are crucial to allow our scholars to work with non-profit organizations across Montreal.\u201d\nThe Doggone Foundation recently made landmark gifts\u00a0to the\u00a0 Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia \u00a0and the\u00a0 McGill University Health Centre . By giving to Concordia, the Doggone Foundation is widening its scope in Montreal.\n\u201cWe started the discussion with the university and then crafted the program together,\u201d says Susan Avon, BFA 88, MA 94, secretary for the Doggone Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it\u2019s already wildly successful and we\u2019re looking forward to what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\u201cAwards like these are vital to our future careers,\u201d says Val\u00e9rie Saulnier, master\u2019s student in\u00a0 music therapy \u00a0and a recipient of an Elspeth McConnell Fine Arts Award. \u201cThe foundation\u2019s encouragement makes me want to work hard so I can give back and make a better society.\u201d\nRelated topics\n"},

Yet, as is the case in all large metropolitan areas, a significant portion of its residents face hurdles due to poverty, poor access to health care and various professional services, social exclusion and other related challenges.\nThat\u2019s where\u00a0 Centraide of Greater Montreal \u00a0steps in. The 350 community agencies and projects in Centraide\u2019s network support one out of seven people living in Greater Montreal \u2014 and nearly 25 per cent living on the island.\nThe slogan for the 2018\u00a0 Concordia Centraide Campaign , \u201cGive to Centraide \u2014\u00a0YUL\u00a0be glad you did,\u201d emphasizes the role of the fundraising organization as a community hub, just as Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport is the city\u2019s air-travel hub.\n\u2018We work to have the seniors\u2019 voices heard\u2019\nOne of those community organizations under the Centraide umbrella is the\u00a0 NDG Senior Citizens\u2019 Council (NDGSCC) . The west-end non-profit is dedicated to improving the quality of life of low-income adults\u00a050 years and older in Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce (NDG), Montreal West and C\u00f4te Saint-Luc. NDGSCC has been around since 1975, the same year Concordia began to raise funds for Centraide.\n\u201cOur role is comprehensive. We provide direct services to adults, including boomers and seniors, who are most vulnerable,\u201d says Sheri McLeod,\u00a0executive director of NDGSCC. \u201cOur range of services include medical transportation, individual advocacy and income tax support, among others.\u201d\nMcLeod explains that NDGSCC has a broad mandate. \u201cWe also have a policy role. We lobby governments at different levels for social change related to issues of aging, housing and poverty. And we\u2019re involved in community development,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWe work to have seniors\u2019 voices heard and to advance cross-population issues in NDG, Montreal West and\u00a0C\u00f4te Saint-Luc. About 1,000 people per year benefit from\u00a0NDGSCC\u2019s services.\u201d\nMcLeod, who has been with the organization for more than 28 years, lends her experience to a number of other regional community groups.\u00a0She\u2019s president of\u00a0 La Coalition pour le maintien dans la communaut\u00e9 (COMACO) , which brings together 80 seniors organizations in the Montreal area\u00a0to deal with grassroots issues such as elder abuse and housing concerns.\nNDGSCC is also a research partner of Concordia\u2019s\u00a0 engAge: the Centre for Research on Aging .\u00a0\nCentraide\u2019s backing is vital for the council, McLeod says. \"They provide about a third of our funding, which allows us to support the vulnerable in our community.\"\nAndrea Clarke of Head & Hands: \"Centraide provides us with reliable funding tied to delivering quality services.\"\n\u2018We\u2019re there to remove the barriers\u2019\nLike NDGSCC,\u00a0 Head & Hands \u00a0is an\u00a0NDG-based\u00a0community organization founded in the 1970s\u00a0and\u00a0committed to assisting those marginalized in society. However, its target population fits into another demographic: youth, primarily between 12 and 25.\n\u201cOur role is to provide services that are as accessible as possible to youth who are facing situations beyond their control.\u00a0The challenges that many people face are further compounded by being young,\u201d says Andrea Clarke, executive director of\u00a0Head & Hands.\n\u201cEssentially, Head & Hands provides legal, medical and social services \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t quite capture it,\u201d Clarke adds. \u201cWe develop our services to meet individual needs. For example, you can access our medical clinic whether you have a RAMQ card or not. If you drop by our Food Pantry , we don\u2019t ask for any proof of your needs. We\u2019re there to remove the barriers.\u201d\nClarke explains that Centraide lends essential financial support to Head & Hands.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks to Centraide, our core funding isn\u2019t left to the whim of political change,\u201d she says. \u201cThey provide us with reliable funding tied to delivering quality services. We both want the same thing.\u201d\nClarke, who has been with\u00a0Head & Hands since 2014, is a three-time Concordia graduate (BSc 09, MSc 12, MBA 16).\u00a0\n\u201cI began at\u00a0Head & Hands while I was doing my MBA,\u201d she says. \u201cI was able to use the organization for my program\u2019s research project. It was a great example of experiential learning.\u201d\nHead & Hands also partners with Concordia\u2019s\u00a0 Office of Community Engagement \u00a0as a location for\u00a0 University of the Streets Caf\u00e9 , which brings\u00a0public conversations into the community.\u00a0\n\u201cConcordia has been very supportive,\u201d she reports.\nHow to contribute\nJoin in making a difference \u2014 give to Centraide.

These initiatives are diverse in nature and require different types of involvement on the part of the OCE and-or Concordia. For the purpose of determining allocation of OCE and Concordia resources as well as the desired level of institutional affiliation, the levels of involvement have been identified:\nWhen the OCE agrees to introduce the organizers of a community engagement initiative to the University unit best positioned to address their request, it agrees to conduct the necessary research, to contact the appropriate internal unit in order to assess their capacity to respond to the request and, then, to connect the individuals involved directly with one another.\nWhen the OCE agrees to promote a community engagement initiative, it agrees to informally disseminate the information through OCE/Concordia channels.\nWhen the OCE agrees to support a community engagement initiative, it agrees to provide a financial contribution and/or the use of Concordia facilities at a discounted rate. Supported initiatives will also be informally promoted through OCE/Concordia channels. \u00a0\nWhen the OCE agrees to partner with a community engagement initiative, it agrees to take part in designing the initiative and/or its associated content. This may involve links to Concordia-led research, student initiatives or other university experts. The OCE will typically be involved throughout the initiative and may provide financial support and/or the use of Concordia facilities at a discounted rate.\nWhen the OCE agrees to incubate a community engagement initiative, it agrees to support the initiative\u2019s emergence through a proof-of-concept exercise and/or through the development of necessary capacities. The impetus for incubation may result from internal or external opportunities that are deemed to fall within the mandate of the OCE. Such initiatives are rolled directly into the OCE\u2019s budget, strategic plan and individual staff work plans.\nWhen deciding to partner on a new community engagement initiative, in addition to reflecting on fit with the above definition, the OCE considers the following:\nAlignment with Concordia\u2019s mission and strategic directions\nAlignment with OCE\u2019s mission and values\nComplementarity to existing OCE programming\nPotential for workload and/or scheduling constraints\nAlex Megelas, Charmaine Lyn, Susan Edey.

The Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy will respond directly to this challenge.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014 Concordia President Alan Shepard\nBuilding for the future\nPoliticians need to make informed choices for their constituencies. When passing a bill, weighing the impact \u2014 whether ethical, environmental or economic \u2014 is increasingly complex, particularly in the areas of engineering and technology.\nGovernment decisions have both immediate and long-term social effects on how energy is used, how people live and how we implement innovations. Despite the gravity of the stakes, there are several obstacles. For one, politicians and scientists often don\u2019t speak the same language. We need experts who can inform debate and shape what\u2019s to come. With your support, the first-of-a-kind Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy can bridge this widening gap.\nFrom policy to practice\nIt is estimated that the Canadian government will spend $750 billion over the next 10 years on infrastructure. Doing so wisely will be key to a more competitive Canadian economy and communal prosperity. Engineering experts trained in public policy will have a critical role to play. Vast and complex amounts of knowledge need to be reliably distilled to help determine how best to strengthen our society and protect our environment.\nFor example, Quebec has taken steps towards cyberphysical power systems \u2014 infrastructure that would allow citizens with solar panels to feed their surplus electricity to the power grid. To successfully achieve this feat, considerations include:\nThe safety of enabling individual access to a public utility;\nHow supply and demand will be affected;\nChanges to infrastructure that enable two-way use of power sources.\n\u00a0\nConcordia scholars and other Canadian researchers explore these issues extensively. Our Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy will provide a channel that connects their latest findings with key decision makers and public- and private-sector stakeholders.\nWith support from visionary donors, the Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy will tackle issues related to:\nTechnological disruption: A study from Oxford University estimates that 47 per cent of jobs in the United States could be performed by robots within the next 20 years. What policies will have the power to absorb the shock of imminent and major disruption?\nClimate change: Optimized road and transit networks can reduce congestion and emissions. Retrofitted and smart buildings can significantly increase energy efficiency. How can we accelerate their implementation?\nEthics: Incredible advances in areas such as bionics \u2014 mechanics that function as an extension of the human body \u2014 are near on the horizon.\u00a0Should we allow laws of supply and demand to decide who gets access?\nSocial justice: Too often, major infrastructure policies have adversely affected Canada\u2019s more vulnerable communities, including Indigenous or urban poor. Do today\u2019s new policy ideas recognize the potential effects on all citizens?\nUniting expertise: How do we reach across disciplines and institutions to produce ingenuity that serves the public good?\nHelp teach for tomorrow\nYour contribution to the Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy will help us:\nLaunch a university think tank that is unique in Canada \u2014 one that breaks down traditional barriers within academia;\nEmpower engineers to contribute to public debate;\nPrepare talent for next-generation work opportunities in an area where demand is likely to surge in Canada;\nProduce research with a direct impact on shaping our collective future.\nSupport Concordia\u2019s Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy\n"},

We\u2019re preparing our students for a world that, in many ways, will be dramatically different than today\u2019s.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014 Concordia President Alan Shepard\nCanada\u2019s next-generation university\nOur applications and admissions are at record highs. In the last decade alone, Concordia\u2019s undergraduate population has grown by 5,000 new scholars. Applicants increasingly list one of our 500 programs as their first choice for study. They are choosing Concordia for a combination of factors: our strong academic reputation, the flexibility we guarantee and our connectedness with society \u2014 through experiential learning and social engagement opportunities. At Concordia, students find a place grounded in the needs of tomorrow.\nAccess to scholarships and financial awards is one of the biggest determining factors in a prospective student\u2019s choice of where to study. To continue to attract top young minds to our next-generation learning environment, we need to grow our financial support for new students. Your contribution to undergraduate financial awards will help recruit more talent to Concordia classrooms, labs and studios. On our campuses, they will gain the tools to face the challenges of a changing world.\nThe cost of being a student\nAnnual tuition, fees and insurance for a Quebec full-time undergraduate student amount to, on average, $4,000. For students from another province, it is more than double. For international students, it amounts to over $20,000. Tack on living expenses, textbooks, transportation and other needs, and it is clear: the cost of being a student can be a major investment.\nSome students depend on support from their family while others take on student loans or part-time work to pay for university. Students in all categories, however, are eager to apply for potential support in the form of scholarships and awards.\nScholarships and financial awards recognize academic excellence as well as accomplishments outside of the classroom. They allow Concordia to recruit driven and dynamic candidates: out-of-the-box thinkers with a penchant for making a difference in the world. Your support of undergraduate awards will advance high-calibre individuals towards their goals.\nAdditionally, financial awards make higher education more accessible. For some, it can be the deciding factor in pursuing an academic degree altogether. Each year, 9,000 undergraduate students at Concordia seek financial aid. They include single parents, students with dependents and students from low-income families. By supporting financial awards for this cohort, you recognize the obstacles faced by financially disadvantaged students on the path to obtaining a university degree.\nWide-reaching impact\nThe Globe and Mail 2017 University Report ranked Concordia among the top in Quebec for our percentage of overall budget disbursed on student support. While we are proud of our commitment to students, with your help, we need to do more.\nConcordia has one of the highest percentages of students in Canada who balance studies with part-time work. Fifty-nine per cent of our first-year students work part-time, compared to the Canadian average of 37 per cent. This practice is not always to a student\u2019s academic advantage. Students who benefit from a financial award report engaging more in student life through campus clubs and associations. Equally, they devote more time to volunteerism, either within the community or abroad.\nSupport for undergraduate awards will:\n\u2022 Recruit outstanding candidates to Concordia.\n\u2022 Allow students to focus on what matters most: their academic and professional development.\n\u2022 Encourage students to immerse themselves in the full university experience.\n\u2022 Help develop Concordia students into tomorrow\u2019s leaders.\n\u2022 Set an example: by providing vital financial support, you inspire others to do the same.\nCreate a student award, create a legacy\nYour vital contribution to undergraduate awards can be designated to a faculty, department or discipline of your choosing. You may also endow your gift and ensure it lasts in perpetuity \u2014 assisting generations of students to come.\nSupport the next generation of thinkers and doers\n"},

Today he is a highly successful businessman who has donated $1 million to endow scholarships at Concordia\u2019s John Molson School of Business (JMSB).\nConsult his La Presse op-ed \u201c Aimons nos universit\u00e9s .\u201d\nTo make ends meet as an immigrant and student, Grewal drove a taxi around the bustling streets of Montreal. Concordia\u2019s flexibility made it possible for him to pull double duty: business classes by day, picking up commuter fares by night.\n\u201cI started at McGill, though I left because I couldn\u2019t manage class and work at the same time,\u201d says Grewal.\n\u201cConcordia understood my situation. They took me in. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been loyal to the university.\u201d\nHardeep Grewal, BComm 83, heads Los Angeles-based OhCal Foods \u2014 one of the largest Subway restaurant developers in North America\nThree decades after graduating from Concordia, Grewal has achieved immense business success as the oversight of 2,100 Subway restaurant franchises in the United States and Canada. He is CEO and president of Los Angeles-based OhCal Foods \u2014 one of the largest Subway developers in North America.\nGrewal\u2019s family \u2014 including wife Patwant and his three sons \u2014 are expressing their gratitude to Concordia with a gift to create the Hardeep Grewal MBA Scholarship Endowment at JMSB, which will produce opportunities for future students.\n\u201cConcordia\u2019s MBA program is a gold standard, in Canada and internationally,\u201d says Concordia President Alan Shepard. \u201cThere\u2019s a circular effect. Many JMSB graduates do incredibly well. One way they show appreciation is by supporting Concordia students, who are in turn equally successful, and it keeps perpetuating.\u201d\n\u201cHardy\u2019s life was transformed through education,\u201d says Bram Freedman, Concordia\u2019s vice-president of Advancement and External Relations. \u201cSuch a significant gift has the capacity of creating a multiplier effect. There will be future generations of business leaders who can be traced back to this generous donation.\u201d\nPromoting family values\nFor Grewal, doing well by his alma mater aligns with his family\u2019s values and aspirations.\nHardy\u2019s photo as it appeared in Concordia\u2019s yearbook\n\u201cMy father and mother were farmers in India \u2014 with only elementary school learning,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir dream for my three siblings and me was to get an education. It lasts your entire life.\u201d\nThey also instilled values Grewal says have served him throughout his career: to work hard and to be honest with others.\nThose qualities inform the selection criteria for Hardeep Grewal MBA Scholarship recipients. Three awardees will be chosen each year on the basis of commitment and spirit that reflect Grewal\u2019s determination \u2014 not to mention his family\u2019s.\nEven though income was limited, Grewal\u2019s parents \u2014 Baldev and Gurdev \u2014 saved their money to send their son to Canada. The country offers more social mobility and opportunities, says Grewal.\nHe left India at age 17 to join an uncle and his older brother, Gurcharan, who arrived in Canada in 1969.\n\u201cI came to Montreal and three days later I was in high school,\u201d says Grewal. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak English or French. I was terrified and didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d\nBecause of the language barrier, Grewal was too discouraged to attend class and eventually dropped out. Though it wasn\u2019t all for nothing. He married his high school sweetheart, Patwant, in 1981.\nAt age 19, Grewal attended Dawson College, then located in Montreal\u2019s Saint-Henri district. Upon graduating from Dawson, Grewal began driving for what would become Angrignon Taxi.\n\u201cThere are wild stories I can tell you about my days as a cabbie,\u201d says Grewal. Among his experiences, Grewal became an unwilling getaway driver \u2014 he was held up at gunpoint by someone fleeing the scene of a bank robbery.\nThrough it all, and after three years of taking class year-round, Grewal received \u201cthe gift of a Concordia education.\u201d\n\u201cAs a recent graduate I began working for an investment company in Montreal,\u201d says Grewal. \u201cI would see income slips of people making $120,000 a year. I thought to myself, can\u2019t I do that?\u201d\nSubway restaurants powerhouse\nOne of Grewal\u2019s distant relatives was the owner of tech company Indus Systems in Chatsworth, Calif. Grewal was offered a job as an accountant and moved to the United States with Patwant in 1984.\nHardeep Grewal (right) with his friend Harjinder Jetha\n\u201cI could get a green card in part because I had a university education,\u201d says Grewal.\nThe husband-and-wife duo had left most of their family and friends when they made the move.\n\u201cMy wife didn\u2019t like being away from Montreal,\u201d says Grewal. Partly to provide Patwant with a diversion, the couple purchased their first Subway restaurant in Los Angeles, Calif., in 1989.\n\u201cThe restaurant my wife was running made about $50,000 each year. That\u2019s more than I was making at the time,\u201d says Grewal. \u201cSo I quit my job and we put everything into purchasing more locations.\u201d\nAfter a few decades and three sons \u2014 named Jess, Amaran and Shawn \u2014 Grewal sold all his locations to purchase OhCal Foods. With it, he gained oversight of all franchise development in Los Angeles County and neighbouring Orange County. In 2009, Grewal bought the rights for Southwestern Ontario. Then in 2015 he added Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage something that\u2019s so far away,\u201d says Grewal, who has racked up over 4 million kilometres of air travel on the job.\nA triumphant return\nThanks to that hard work, a bright, picturesque space on the fourth floor of Concordia\u2019s John Molson Building \u2014 where students come together \u2014 has a new name.\nThe Hardeep (Hardy) Singh Grewal and Patwant Kaur Grewal Atrium was titled in recognition of the Concordian\u2019s seven-figure donation.\n\u201cAll students who come to Concordia hope to have an impact of some kind,\u201d says St\u00e9phane Brutus, interim dean of the JMSB. \u201cThe naming of spaces at the John Molson Building is a high-water mark that all can be encouraged by.\u201d\nGrewal says he was partly motivated to give for that reason: \u201cI visited one of my sons at UCLA. It struck me that everything was named after someone. I find that very inspirational.\u201d\nHe realized he wanted to do the same for his alma mater.\n\u201cI know where I came from,\u201d says Grewal. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have my name attached to the school that was a building block for me.\u201d\nGrewal says it\u2019s special for his entire family.

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

Bob and his wife Raye will help the next generation of students reach their full potential and the JMSB chart new territory in business studies.\u201d\nJMSB Dean Steve Harvey says the Briscoes\u2019 gift creates a new focus on research and teaching in business ownership \u2014 an underrepresented area of entrepreneurship.\n\u201cBob is a great example of someone who has given back abundantly to the institution he credits as providing him the tools to succeed,\u201d Harvey says.\n\u201cI feel we owe it to Concordia,\u201d says Bob Briscoe, who earned his two degrees by enrolling in night classes, part-time, over 12 years while also working full-time.\nConcordia celebrated the gift from the Briscoes during a ceremony at the John Molson School of Business on October 23, 2015.\nListen to a podcast of the speeches:\nGetting a postsecondary education was a journey beset with obstacles for Briscoe.\n\u201cWhen I graduated from high school, my parents couldn\u2019t send me to university,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe\u00a0other\u00a0issue was that we got married straight out of high school and had children right away!\u201d\nTo support their young family, Briscoe went to work while Raye Briscoe stayed home to take care of their four children. The only way he could pursue his education was by going to night school. In the 1960s, Sir George Williams was the sole English institution offering university-level evening courses in Montreal.\nBriscoe\u2019s dozen years of part-time study \u2014 six for his BSc and six for his MBA \u2014 were challenging for the young couple. Raye Briscoe recalls how difficult it was to respond to one of her daughters, after she asked why her father was still going to school when all her friends\u2019 dads had finished their studies a long time ago.\n\u201cIt was hard to explain to her that this was so important, that other people could go during the day but he couldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cGetting those degrees was incredibly worth it in the end, but we didn\u2019t know just how worthwhile it would be at the time.\u201d\nBob Briscoe initially wanted to be a research chemist, yet when he finished his undergraduate degree he realized that managers were paid a lot more. So he became a student in the first-ever class of the newly hatched\u00a0 MBA program \u00a0at Sir George Williams in 1969.\nRobert Briscoe earned his two Concordia degrees while working full-time to support his family. | Photo courtesy: Concordia Archives\nBy the time he finished his MBA, Briscoe knew he wanted to be a business owner. \u201cIt was an evolution,\u201d he says, crediting those night classes for giving him the opportunity to find his true calling and laying the groundwork for his career.\nHis legacy includes three decades as president of Macco Organiques Inc. , a food and pharmachemical company based in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Que.\nIn 1987, Briscoe invested in IEC Holden \u2014 a North American-based manufacturer of electrical rotating equipment and components \u2014 and currently acts as chairman of the board. He was also president of AlimPlus Inc. for 25 years, a company he formed in 1990.\nBriscoe served as chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce from 2001 to 2002. He received the Alumnus of the Year Award from the Concordia University Alumni Association in 2002.\nThe secret to his rise to success, he says, is to defer gratification. \u201cIf you buy a business and you\u2019re eating out at expensive restaurants every night, driving a BMW and spending all your earnings, then very likely you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Briscoe says.\nTo be successful, he explains, you need to save and reinvest what you make. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did,\u201d adds Raye Briscoe, noting how the couple refrained from indulging in any big expenses for the first 12 years of their marriage.\n\u201cWe never did anything,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cWe went out once a year \u2014 on our anniversary \u2014 and that was it!\u201d\nInspiring future business owners\nScheduled to open its doors in 2016, the Bob and Raye Briscoe Centre in Business Ownership Studies will provide a space for students and faculty to cultivate ties with the business community, as well as support teaching and research on business ownership.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to entrepreneurship than inventing something new,\u201d says Bob Briscoe, who made a living by growing existing businesses into successful companies.\nProviding mentorship to future business owners is exactly what the Briscoes hope the new centre will offer. \u201cNothing is more motivating than hearing a story of real, hard-earned success,\u201d says William Meder, BComm 65, the centre\u2019s incoming director. \u201cOur goal is to bring successful alumni back to Concordia and give them the opportunity to speak to students and share their experience.\u201d\nA long-time friend of the Briscoes, Meder says he learned a lot about helping students achieve their goals from his five years as academic advisor for the John Molson MBA International Case Competition . He hopes the centre\u2019s resources will encourage students to aspire towards becoming owners rather than just employees.\nRaye and Bob Briscoe share that hope. As Raye Briscoe says, \u201cStudents need to feel that they can do it, and the centre will be there to help them build that confidence.\u201d\nRelated topics\n"},

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

People of all ages and backgrounds gather to learn, share, make and get inspired at Maker Faires around the world, from Beijing to Orlando, Fla., and from Rio de Janeiro to Hyderabad, India.\nConcordia is hosting a local edition \u2014 the Montreal Mini Maker Faire \u2014 on November 16 and 17, 2018, in the atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building).\nThe family-friendly show-and-tell event will feature the work of more than 50 tech enthusiasts, crafters, tinkerers, hobbyists, scientists and artists. Their inventions run the gamut from life-sized replicas of Star Wars droids and electronic table-top game demos to homemade synthesizers and high-powered rocket models.\nBart Simon , associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and director of Concordia\u2019s Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology , is co-producer of the Mini Maker Faire along with Ann-Louise Davidson , associate professor in the Department of Education , and Lynn Hughes, Department of Studio Arts professor emerita.\nSimon notes that the event aligns perfectly with the university\u2019s strategic priorities to double our research and get your hands dirty .\n\u201cThe maker movement is where art, education and technology converge. Our university is also a unifier of cross-disciplinary initiatives,\u201d says Simon.\n\"This event is about more than creating a showcase for makers around Montreal. As society shifts at an ever-increasing pace, maker culture becomes critical as a movement, a set of practices and shared values for taking control over the technologies that define us. This kind of critical making is the new liberal arts for the 21st century and with this event, Concordia puts itself front and centre in the debate about what universities can become.\"\nAnn-Louise Davidson (pictured centre): \u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d\nMaker culture is everywhere\nDavidson , who also holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Maker Culture, says that with two unique on-campus maker spaces, as well as several subject-matter experts, Concordia has emerged as a leader in maker culture.\n\u201cMaker spaces, such as the Technology Sandbox in the Webster Library and our Education Makers Space at Milieux, have traditional tools \u2014 hammers, saws and solders \u2014 along with emerging tech equipment such as 3D printers. And with this new gear comes an innovative way of learning.\u201d\nDavidson notes that the maker movement helps people build 21st-century skills by empowering them to respond to the world around them and create their own \u2014 mostly technology-based \u2014 inventions.\n\u201cMaker culture is everywhere,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt embodies do-it-yourself tinkering \u2014 which refers to making small changes to something to improve it \u2014 using affordable open-source computers, electronics and recycled items.\u201d\nAs an example, Davidson explains that instead of purchasing a 3D printer for the Milieux maker space, she created a community of practice to develop the expertise to build their own printers stating that the whole spirit of maker culture is to create, share, remix and connect.\n\u201cThrough making, we learn invaluable life lessons, engage in persistent, complex problem-solving and create solutions to real-world problems.\u201d\nDavidson is holding a public symposium about her research on November 18, during Concordia\u2019s inaugural Conference on Maker Cultures , which directly follows the fair.\n\u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe Maker Faire is the thing to do in November in Montreal.

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

Sebastian van Berkom, BComm 69, came from humble beginnings. Decades later, he\u2019s happily investing a tidy sum in his alma mater.\nThrough a $1 million donation, the Montreal investment manager will help top-rated John Molson School of Business students manage small-cap portfolios \u2014 with real money.\nListen to the podcast\nView our commemorative booklet.\nVan Berkom\u2019s transformational gift will establish the Van Berkom Small-Cap Investment Management Program, where eight students per year will manage funds with a view to achieving above-average returns long term.\nWhy give to his alma mater? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d says van Berkom, whose companies Van Berkom and Associates Inc. (Canada) and Van Berkom Golden Dragon Limited (Hong Kong) employ 20 people and manage a portfolio of international small-cap stocks worth $4 billion. \u201cSir George accepted me as a student and I\u2019ve done tremendously well ever since.\u201d\nVan Berkom has to date donated $2.3 million to Concordia. \u201cThere\u2019s only a certain amount of money one needs in life,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, I believe in giving back to society.\u201d\nHis gifts at Concordia support the Van Berkom Chair in Small-Cap Equities Endowment, the Van Berkom JMSB Small-Cap Case Competition , the Van Berkom and Associates Inc. Bursary, the Frederick Lowy Scholars Endowment and now the Van Berkom Small-Cap Investment Management Program.\n\u201cSebastian\u2019s latest contribution to the John Molson School of Business builds on a legacy of tremendous generosity towards his alma mater,\u201d says Concordia President Alan Shepard. \u201cStudents will gain exceptional experience \u2014 knowledge that opens doors to careers in global capital markets, thanks to his remarkable gift.\u201d\nFrom left: Katherine Yutong Liu, MBA student; Steve Harvey, dean of the John Molson School of Business; Sebastian van Berkom, BComm 69, president and CEO of Van Berkom and Associates; Concordia President Alan Shepard; and Bram Freedman, vice-president, Development and External Relations, and Secretary-General, Concordia. Dean Harvey holds a commemorative recreation of student newspaper The Georgian. | Credit: Joe Dresdner\nA champion of healthcare and the arts, van Berkom made headlines last November when his $500,000 gift to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts enabled the institution to permanently acquire a popular bright yellow blown-glass sculpture \u2014 the Sun \u2014 by American artist Dale Chihuly.\nThe decision, van Berkom says, was a no-brainer. \u201cMy father was a commercial artist through whom I learned to love art. I saw this as a great opportunity to save the Sun for the museum and Montrealers.\u201d\nBack in the 1950s, when van Berkom\u2019s family emigrated from the Netherlands, cash flow was tighter. \u201cWe were poor,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf I needed something I had to make the money myself.\u201d\nThat work ethic resonates with John Molson School of Business Dean Steve Harvey\u2019s impression of van Berkom, a man he calls ethical, hardworking and committed.\n\u201cSebastian represents what we want our students to be when they graduate,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cHe appreciates the support he received at Concordia. One of the best ways to thank his supporters \u2014 and to ensure support continues for others \u2014 has been for Sebastian to give back.\u201d\nVan Berkom learned the value of a dollar growing up in Rosem\u00e8re, Que. He shovelled driveways and delivered newspapers. \u201cI needed money to go to dances on Saturday nights,\u201d he says.\nAs an entrepreneurial undergraduate, van Berkom and classmate Danny Rafman sold shirts in the corridors of the Henry F. Hall Building. Profits from their garments funded van Berkom\u2019s commerce degree.\nHe\u2019s grateful to Concordia. \u201cI was a terrible high school student. I did everything but study.\u201d Yet the day came, van Berkom recalls, \u201cwhere I wondered where I was going in life.\u201d He applied to Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia\u2019s founding institutions.\nGumption won him a place as a marketing major. \u201cThe admissions officer said: \u2018Mr. van Berkom, we\u2019re going to give you a chance.\u2019 I was ecstatic. \u201cI graduated with top marks. My professor said \u2018Sebastian, you\u2019ve got to go to Harvard.\u2019 I said \u2018I don\u2019t have the money, I\u2019m going to work.\u2019\u201d\nJ. Sebastian van Berkom appears in the front row, second from left, in this photo of the 1966-67 Sir George Williams University Junior Varsity hockey team.\nJ. Sebastian van Berkom, BComm 69\nVan Berkom landed a job at DuPont Canada in 1969. Incredibly, he wanted to be president from day one. \u201cI wanted to run the show.\u201d\nInstead, he left for a marketing job at CN. \u201cI had to find the right place where I could do what I wanted to do \u2014 put things together, find a direction.\u201d At CN he got wind of an opening at Bell and, by 28, was running the Canadian equity portfolio of the firm\u2019s pension fund.\n\u201cWe worked 18 hour days,\u201d van Berkom recalls. It was at Bell where Scott Fraser, a mentor, offered him a partnership in LRM Investment Management. \u201cScotty really loved the way I chose stocks.\u201d\nIrrepressible, van Berkom grew frustrated. \u201cWe had only $200 million in assets under management,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to build this investment counselling firm into something big.\u201d\nThe growth he sought came in the form of Montrusco, an investment management company that grew out of Montreal Trust. \u201cI was one of the founding partners and I did that for seven years,\u201d van Berkom recalls. \u201cWe grew it substantially. I made a lot of money.\n\u201cHowever, my love for small-cap investing and being a master of my own destiny became so compelling that I quit Montrusco to start Van Berkom and Associates Inc. in 1991 to concentrate my efforts solely on small-caps.\u201d\nThree years ago, van Berkom founded Van Berkom Golden Dragon Limited, in Hong Kong, to begin investing in Asian small-cap equities.\nThe future? \u201cMy dream is to build a global small-cap equity management firm,\u201d van Berkom says adding that he plans to retire at 80. \u201cEighty is the new 60. I think if you stop working you die.\u201d\nRelated topics\n"},

The Long Table format allows for voices to be heard equally, disrupting hierarchical notions of \u2018expertise.\u2019\u201d\nAttendees are invited to participate according to their comfort level: those who wish to speak sit at the table while those who wish to listen are seated in the spectator chairs along the walls of the room. You can move from or to the table at any time. The hosts provide an etiquette sheet and starter questions to encourage respectful dialogue. Light snacks will be provided.\n\u201cA flurry of conversations have emerged online around #MeToo,\u201d says Krista Lynes , Director, Feminist Media Studio. \u201cThe movement\u2019s founder Tarana Burke argues that we need to shift the conversation, looking at how we demand accountability and how we seek justice. With this event, we hope to offer a space for a productive and challenging in-person conversation, where we can all share the thoughts and critiques we have been ruminating over since the #MeToo movement emerged.\u201d\nYou can learn more about the event, read about the invited guests and follow the discussion with The Feminist Media Lab and A.A.S.K.

People of all ages and backgrounds gather to learn, share, make and get inspired at Maker Faires around the world, from Beijing to Orlando, Fla., and from Rio de Janeiro to Hyderabad, India.\nConcordia is hosting a local edition \u2014 the Montreal Mini Maker Faire \u2014 on November 16 and 17, 2018, in the atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building).\nThe family-friendly show-and-tell event will feature the work of more than 50 tech enthusiasts, crafters, tinkerers, hobbyists, scientists and artists. Their inventions run the gamut from life-sized replicas of Star Wars droids and electronic table-top game demos to homemade synthesizers and high-powered rocket models.\nBart Simon , associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and director of Concordia\u2019s Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology , is co-producer of the Mini Maker Faire along with Ann-Louise Davidson , associate professor in the Department of Education , and Lynn Hughes, Department of Studio Arts professor emerita.\nSimon notes that the event aligns perfectly with the university\u2019s strategic priorities to double our research and get your hands dirty .\n\u201cThe maker movement is where art, education and technology converge. Our university is also a unifier of cross-disciplinary initiatives,\u201d says Simon.\n\"This event is about more than creating a showcase for makers around Montreal. As society shifts at an ever-increasing pace, maker culture becomes critical as a movement, a set of practices and shared values for taking control over the technologies that define us. This kind of critical making is the new liberal arts for the 21st century and with this event, Concordia puts itself front and centre in the debate about what universities can become.\"\nAnn-Louise Davidson (pictured centre): \u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d\nMaker culture is everywhere\nDavidson , who also holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Maker Culture, says that with two unique on-campus maker spaces, as well as several subject-matter experts, Concordia has emerged as a leader in maker culture.\n\u201cMaker spaces, such as the Technology Sandbox in the Webster Library and our Education Makers Space at Milieux, have traditional tools \u2014 hammers, saws and solders \u2014 along with emerging tech equipment such as 3D printers. And with this new gear comes an innovative way of learning.\u201d\nDavidson notes that the maker movement helps people build 21st-century skills by empowering them to respond to the world around them and create their own \u2014 mostly technology-based \u2014 inventions.\n\u201cMaker culture is everywhere,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt embodies do-it-yourself tinkering \u2014 which refers to making small changes to something to improve it \u2014 using affordable open-source computers, electronics and recycled items.\u201d\nAs an example, Davidson explains that instead of purchasing a 3D printer for the Milieux maker space, she created a community of practice to develop the expertise to build their own printers stating that the whole spirit of maker culture is to create, share, remix and connect.\n\u201cThrough making, we learn invaluable life lessons, engage in persistent, complex problem-solving and create solutions to real-world problems.\u201d\nDavidson is holding a public symposium about her research on November 18, during Concordia\u2019s inaugural Conference on Maker Cultures , which directly follows the fair.\n\u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe Maker Faire is the thing to do in November in Montreal. Revealing our creativity, our ingenuity, our collaboration skills and our capacity for inclusion, it positions Concordia as a leader in the local maker ecosystem. We welcome every tinkerer, geek, inventor, creator, DIYer and even the curious.\u201d\nFrom model airplanes to mushroom roots\nThe 50-plus inventors displaying their work at the Montreal Mini Maker Faire includes five Concordians.\nBora Bodur , a master\u2019s student in educational technology, is bringing his large model airplane built entirely from 3D printed parts.\nNathalie Duponsel ,\u00a0a PhD student in educational technology, is showing projects that she created as part of the Chalet Kent makerspace project, a partnership that aims to develop a community of makers with Maison des Jeunes and help children become successful in a competitive world through STEAM activities.\nTh\u00e9o Chauvirey , a master\u2019s student in design and computation arts, is displaying the potential of mycelium (mushroom roots) in public transport design, as well as a dress produced with bacterial cellulose and embedded 3D printed patterns.\nMatthew Silverstein , a mechanical engineering student in the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, is showing a 3D printer he built, as part of a team, out of a milk crate, called the Milkcreator.\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9ger , an instructor in the John Molson School of Business, is presenting an open-source large format 3D printer that he assembled.\nAnd while on campus, why not check out the What is Food? show in Concordia\u2019s new 4th SPACE venue, which offers plenty of its own maker-related activites: raising crickets, growing food indoors, preparing vegan cheese, and testing the sugar content of homemade kombucha.\nDon\u2019t miss the Montreal Mini Maker Faire , taking place on November 16 and 17, 2018, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Abe and Harriet Gold Atrium of Concordia\u2019s Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 Ste.

Its unique experiential design consists of small and large group sessions whereby a semi-structured learning environment will assist you in developing your competencies in the following areas:\nIncrease your ability to understand yourself and others in the context of work/ task-focused relationships\nIncrease personal and task effectiveness in a diverse, multicultural environment\nEnhance your understanding of group functioning and effectiveness\nEnhance your understanding of your role in effective and productive groups\nDemonstrate the capacity to give and receive feedback with care and accountability\nGain a deeper understanding of group development and group dynamics to achieve success\nOpen new paths of communication and personal insight\nIncrease your awareness of the impact you have on others and how others impact you\n\u00a0\nProgram Methodology and Design\nThe Human Interaction Lab is designed as an interactive learning experience working both in small groups and large community sessions. By working in small groups, participants will have an opportunity to experience the impact of their interpersonal communication styles on other participants and on the groups which have been formed. The majority of each day is spent in small groups where members work with each other around semi-structured tasks. In addition to the small group work, the Laboratory includes large group discussions, theory sessions and experiential exercises. The more structured sessions focus on topics which flow from the group's dynamics and lead to a deeper understanding of broader issues related to interpersonal and group dynamics.\nWho should attend?\nParticipants in this program will increase their understanding of groups and group processes; build on and maximize their competence in working with people; increase their awareness in regards to interpersonal dynamics and communication skills; and increase their effectiveness in giving and receiving feedback. Individuals must have an openness and willingness to work on themselves and in relation to others. The HI Lab is an entry point into the Department of Applied Human Science's Human Systems Intervention graduate program. Participants come from a broad range of backgrounds and positions in the fields of social services, business, industry, health services, government, education, religion and the volunteer sector.\nCriteria for participation in this program\nParticipants in this program attend because they choose to attend, and not because they are forced to. They should be sufficiently familiar with the nature of human interaction laboratory in order to make an informed decision about attendance.\nEach participant should have a genuine desire to learn about her/himself, about interpersonal communication/interpersonal relations, and about the impact of behavior on others, in small groups and teams.\nThere is mandatory participation in all the activities of this Lab. Should a participant miss an activity, it is the responsibility of that participant to inform the trainers of the reason for the absence. Participants may discontinue their attendance but this will result in a failure to meet the criteria for successful completion of the Lab.\nFull-time residence is required of all participants.\nNo person concerned about entering a stressful situation should participate in this program. During our long history of offering this program, an extremely small percentage of participants have experienced stress in varying degrees. There is no effective means of predicting such reactions, screening out or otherwise identifying those predisposed to such reactions based on their prior medical history or present emotional problems which have been identified. It is important, therefore, that participants take the responsibility for \"self-screening\" in this matter. Attendance should be discussed with appropriate professionals, including medical doctors or psychotherapists, should the participant have any concerns.\nParticipants will have ample opportunities to develop and demonstrate their competencies in interpersonal communication through daily interactions. Opportunities will also be given to give and receive feedback about behaviors and the impact this has on you personally, on others and how this affects group dynamics and effectiveness in achieving task-oriented goals.\nThe trainers will be responsible for observing and assessing the above-mentioned competencies and will determine your readiness level (knowledge, skills and abilities) to move on to further laboratory learning. The trainers will provide participants with feedback and will inform the Centre of successful completion.\nThe Centre will send each participant an official notification of completion based on the feedback received from the facilitators. It is the responsibility of each participant to share this information with the appropriate person (if required).\nH.I. Lab Fee\n$1,695 includes all program materials (residential stay is extra)\nDates and times of H.I. Lab\nMay 27 - June 1, 2018\nThe program runs: Sunday, 4 pm- Friday, 1 pm\nLocation\nResidential program is held at Jouvence located in Orford, Quebec . An additional fee of $895 plus taxes for the five days can be paid directly to Jouvence at the end of your stay, and includes three meals per day plus refreshments.\nDeadline for Registration\n"},

This Concordia researcher only needs a few drops\nDajana Vuckovic is using mass spectrometry to speed up medical diagnosis and treatment\nMay 24, 2017\nDajana Vuckovic , an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry in Concordia\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Science , is improving the amount of biochemical information that can be measured from a few drops of blood.\nThe desired result? To speed up medical testing, diagnosis and the identification of correct treatments.\nAs she explains: \u201cRight now, your doctor will send you to do a blood test. Then the results come back, and the doctor asks you to go for a second test. This can continue for several iterations until the doctor can correctly diagnose and treat you.\u201d To improve this process, Vuckovic measures hundreds of biomolecules in a single test, rather than measuring a single diagnostic marker as is currently done.\nVuckovic\u2019s research team uses mass spectrometry, a technology that allows them to measure incredibly small quantities of molecules \u2014 one billionth of a gram of a pharmaceutical drug, say \u2014 in a blood or urine sample, or as few as 50 biomolecules in a single cell.\n\u201cWe are pushing the limits of how many metabolites we can measure, how accurately we can do this measurement and how we can best use this data to determine someone\u2019s health status,\u201d Vuckovic says.\nThis exciting new area of research is called metabolomics. It brings together an interdisciplinary mix of researchers from the fields of chemistry, biology, computer science, medicine and statistics.\n\u201cThe extensive amount of metabolic information will allow us to better monitor a patient\u2019s health status. This will help in the development of personalized medicine and personalized preventive health.\u201d\n\u2018We must make sure that young women have role models\u2019\nVuckovic, who holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Clinical Metabolomics, Biomarkers and Preventive Health , finds analytical chemistry to be an exciting and dynamic discipline \u2014 one that touches all aspects of our daily lives.\n\u201cIt helps us keep our food and water safe, develop safe medication and vaccines, diagnose diseases, solve crimes and measure environmental contaminants.\u201d\nVuckovic is currently expanding the scope of her work to examine the effect of food contamination on our health, specifically from compounds called mycotoxins.\nShe chose Concordia for its vibrant atmosphere \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s collegial, dynamic, innovative and interdisciplinary\u201d \u2014 and points to facilities at the Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry (CBAMS) that have allowed her to advance her research.\nAn advocate for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), Vuckovic was influenced by her own mother, a mechanical engineer in the aerospace and automotive industries.\n\u201cShe showed me that women can succeed in any field,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWe must make sure that young women have role models, and that they pursue their passion for science and engineering. We must all work to make the accomplishments of female scientists and engineers more visible and accessible to all age groups.\u201d\nVuckovic is thrilled to experience her colleagues\u2019 evolution first-hand.\n\u201cI recently saw my first graduate student receive her degree.

This understanding would not only influence the design, format and timing of learning experiences, but also the development and implementation of strategies, skills and norms within groups and teams.\nDr. Raye Kass is a Professor of Applied Human Sciences at Concordia University (Montreal QC). Specializing in leadership and small group behaviour, she is the author of Theories of Small Group Development and co-author of three other books.\nDr. Kass currently spearheads group theory courses in both the undergraduate and graduate level. Professor Kass is highly involved within the Department\u2019s teaching profile, having taught seventeen different courses, and extensively redesigned many of the counselling and group theory courses that the Department offers today. She was also instrumental in the creation of the Human Systems Intervention graduate level-program, which sees applications from across the globe.\nDr. Kass has led over 1000 workshops in leadership training, communication and problem-solving skills, staff development, team building and conflict management with various universities, research centres, schools, hospitals, penitentiaries, government departments and organizations in Canada, USA, Europe and Asia.\nDr. Kass has been highlighted frequently by both national and international press agencies for both her space sciences and group theory research. Dr Kass was Principal Investigator on two space simulation missions: the 1994 CAPSULS Mission held in Canada and the 240 day space simulation SFINCSS Mission held in Russia in 1999 \u2013 2000.

Nous acceptons le fait qu\u2019il est impossible de couvrir exhaustivement un sujet dans une conversation de deux\u00a0heures. Nous croyons que la discussion prend naturellement la meilleure direction qui soit, puisque c\u2019est une r\u00e9flexion collective qui l\u2019oriente.\nUne conversation publique ne saurait combler toutes les attentes. Nous ne pr\u00e9tendons pas aborder toutes les perspectives ni r\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes \u00e9pineux au cours d\u2019une seule rencontre.\nL\u2019exp\u00e9rience importe autant que l\u2019expertise. Ces deux\u00a0aspects contribuent au succ\u00e8s de toute discussion. Nul doute, ils conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 nos \u00e9changes un caract\u00e8re non seulement intime et m\u00e9morable, mais \u00e9galement \u00e9ducatif.\nUn cadre s\u00fbr et inclusif se cr\u00e9e par la pratique, et non simplement par d\u00e9cret. Nous mettons tout en \u0153uvre pour cr\u00e9er un environnement respectueux. Nous nous effor\u00e7ons aussi de m\u00e9nager une place \u00e0 chacun. Cependant, nos conversations n\u2019en restent pas moins publiques. Compte tenu entre autres du lieu, du sujet, du langage et du degr\u00e9 de vulgarisation, des personnes s\u2019estimeront in\u00e9vitablement exclues.\nLa technologie d\u00e9courage la participation. L\u2019utilisation de microphones, de pr\u00e9sentations PowerPoint ou d\u2019appareils enregistreurs, quels qu\u2019ils soient, dissuade les interventions et perturbe la dynamique des \u00e9changes. C\u2019est pourquoi nos activit\u00e9s valorisent le face-\u00e0-face et l\u2019interaction en temps r\u00e9el.\nChaque intervenante, chaque intervenant, participe \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on. Nous incitons les participants \u00e0 partager l\u2019espace en portant attention \u00e0 leur temps de parole. De m\u00eame, nous encourageons les timides \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer, sans jamais toutefois les forcer. Faut-il le pr\u00e9ciser? L\u2019\u00e9coute constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de toute discussion.\n"},

The workshop brought together youth, practitioners, and educators from all over the world to connect around promising practices for youth/adult partnerships. Presenters ignited interactive dialogue inspired by an earlier collaboration that emerged in the edited book Emancipatory Practices: Adult/Youth Engagement for Social and Environmental Justice (Linds, Goulet, & Sammel, 2010).\nThe workshop was planned to maximize the sharing of knowledge, to critically dialogue on application, and to illuminate underlying assumptions involved in adopting emancipatory approaches to youth engagement.\nBased on the workshop, the teaching guide offers insights and thinking strategies that illustrate how youth and adult can collaboratively explore opportunities and obstacles for extending youth engagement beyond a mere trend, toward a transformative, value-driven practice. It introduces key themes relating to youth engagement and provides a series of activities\u2014from discussion questions and story sharing to case studies and creative projects\u2014that progress from conceptual to practical considerations to help guide thinking and strategizing about meaningful working relationships between youth and adults.\nAbout youth engagement\nBroadening and deepening youth engagement beyond a shift from youth as objects to subjects entails youth workers and educators grappling with the significance of building real, respectful and transformative youth/adult partnerships. Linds, Goulet, and Sammel (2010) define emancipatory approaches broadly \u201cas those that enable youth to develop agency as active participants working in partnership with adults in the development of youth leadership and community change\u201d (p. xiii). Strategies to implement emancipatory approaches include peer-to-peer and youth/adult mentorships that provide guidance and experience sharing to help other youth and adults realize the potential of youth engagement, overcome fears, imagine possibilities and take action. The Transforming Practices documentary and teaching guide offer rich, innovative ideas and examples of how emancipatory, collaborative work involving youth and adults can contribute to social justice.\nThemes covered\n"},

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

Conversations are hosted by a volunteer moderator who is there to welcome everyone and keep things on track. To get things started, there\u2019s a guest, or sometimes two, who get the ball rolling by sharing their ideas, experiences and questions. After that, it's all up to the participants. Whether they share a personal experience, a researched opinion, or a half-formed thought \u2013 or even if they prefer to simply listen \u2013 it\u2019s the people in the room who really bring these participatory events to life.

To date, we have organized over 400 public conversations in caf\u00e9s and community spaces across Montreal.\nWe believe that the simple act of talking with one another provides an incredible opportunity for growth, empowerment, community building and social change.\u00a0 With this in mind, the programming we offer is about real-time, people-centered, face-to-face public conversations. As a flagship program of Concordia University\u2019s Office of Community Engagement, the bilingual events organized by University of the Streets Caf\u00e9 are free and open to participants of all ages, backgrounds and levels of education.\nCore Beliefs\nIt\u2019s ok to start simple. We accept that it\u2019s impossible to cover everything in a 2 hour conversation and believe that the intelligence of the group always brings the conversation where it needs to go.\nPublic conversations cannot be all things to all people. These events do not seek to cover all views, nor do they attempt to resolve complex problems in a single night.\nExperience matters just as much as expertise. The most successful conversations are a blend of both, making the space feel intimate and memorable, but also educational.\nSafe and inclusive spaces are created, not stated. We do our best to create respectful spaces and include everyone but we know that a) conversations are still public and b) people will always be excluded by virtue of topic, language, venue, outreach, etc.\nTechnology stunts participation. The use of microphones, power point presentations and recording devices of any kind inhibits participation and changes the dynamic of a conversation. Instead our events emphasize the value of real-time, face-to-face interactions.\nEach person participates differently. We encourage our participants to share the space by being mindful of their speaking time and we try to make room for our shyer participants, but we never force anyone to speak. Listening is an equally important part of any conversation.\n"},

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

It is now part of Concordia\u2019s key initiatives to support its strategic directions for a next-generation university.\nThe new team of graduate students will be representatives of the university\u2019s exciting new research. They will receive extensive training in social media, government relations, op-ed writing and public speaking.\nOn March 20, you will have the opportunity to exchange with the new public scholars at a special event. As well, the 10 members of the first cohort, who are wrapping up their tenure, will each present a short synopsis of their groundbreaking research .\n\u00a0\nHumanities\nCan you describe your research?\nI study emerging food practices and how ideas about edibility evolve and adapt, with a specific focus on entomophagy \u2013 the consumption of insects \u2013 in non-traditional cultural contexts.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nOver the last few years, there has been a growing interest in edible insects. It\u2019s a timely topic in its preoccupation with sustainability and food security issues. As environmental degradation and public-health concerns press us to transform our lifestyle habits, it becomes crucial to understand how tastes and food preferences can evolve to accommodate novel foods.\nThrough the Public Scholars program, I want to translate these research insights into operative takeaways that can influence policy work and take part in the public discussion of crucial contemporary food issues.\u00a0\nMichelle Savard\nEducation Studies\nCan you describe your research?\nMy research examines three approaches to the reintegration of war-affected and formerly abducted young mothers in Northern Uganda. It also looks at the differences and outcomes between these approaches, such as social inclusion, livelihood and competent functioning.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nThe program aims to dispel myths about the purpose of knowledge produced in the \u201civory tower\u201d by facilitating exchanges between scholars and the community. This is very much aligned with my personal goal to become a bridge between academe and practitioners.\nI believe the program will help me expand the reach of my research and cultivate the speaking and writing skills necessary to talk to non-specialist audiences. I also expect the program to expand my network and enhance my career possibilities.\nAmir Hooshiar\nMechanical Engineering\nCan you describe your research?\nI focus on re-creating tactile sensing for surgeons during robot-assisted cardiovascular interventional surgery. This technology will help improve a surgeon\u2019s dexterity, precision and accuracy, while reducing the length of the surgery and the post-operative rehabilitation time.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nAs a Vanier Scholar , I have a great responsibility to promote my field to the public. I am expected to engage in cutting-edge research and make a real contribution to the Canadian and global community. I will only succeed on these planes if I get to talk directly with people.\nMoreover, since my research field is very niche, raising its awareness through public media such as newspapers, radio and television networks, and social media, is necessary for acquiring support and investment. This program provides a platform for learning and practicing this academia-public dialog.\u00a0\nNura Jabagi\nBusiness Technology Management\nCan you describe your research?\nI explore the gig economy and the shifting employment landscape from job-for-life to job-for-a-day. I aim to help organizations leverage new technologies to connect with independent gig-workers in order to achieve organizational goals.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nAs a practitioner-turned-academic, my interest in the program stems from an appreciation for engaged scholarship. Too often, the intended beneficiaries of research (practitioners) are forgotten. This is unfortunate since the popularity of authors like Malcolm Gladwell, who has made a living translating academic research for the lay-person, affirms public interest in the work we do.\nIn addition to improving my communication skills and\u00a0benefiting from a platform to share my research with a broader audience,\u00a0I hope to leverage this program to build connections with the business community, since doing so will enable me to craft more relevant and impactful research.\nNikola Stepi\u0107\nHumanities\nCan you describe your research?\nMy research looks at visual representations of cities as interfaces of sexuality and desire, with a specific interest in the relationship between the tradition of city film and queer cinema.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nThe Public Scholars program is not only a unique opportunity to share my research with a wider audience, it\u2019s also a chance to measure how accountable, rigorous and relevant my research questions and methods are.\nAs a student pursuing a PhD in Humanities, it is important for me to remain conscious of the immediate, palpable societal circumstances while still aiming to produce knowledge that is transhistorical and transnational in its scope.\nThe greatest benefit of this program is that in opening up academia and making its processes more visible, it simultaneously demands more awareness of its contexts and conditions.\u00a0\nBakhtiar Ali Khan\nElectrical Engineering\nCan you describe your research?\nIn the most fundamental terms, my research is focused on the study of electromagnetics. The applications of this well-established field are ubiquitous. My work is mainly focused on antenna design for satellite and space applications.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nIn order to be a well-rounded engineer, it is of paramount importance to have impeccable communication skills. It is not only helpful in one\u2019s own field, but it is somewhat pivotal to be able to communicate with the people that are not necessarily from an engineering background.\nThe Public Scholar Program intrigued me for this particular reason. The program provides a platform that allows one to acquire good communication skills and, at the same time, contribute to bringing attention to my research.\nEric Fillion\nHistory\nCan you describe your research?\nMy project traces the origins of Canada\u2019s cultural diplomacy, by looking at how race and empire informed the making of a musically imagined Canadian-Brazilian community between 1938 and 1968.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nMy interest in the program derives from my interest in public diplomacy. There are, after all, parallels between the latter and public scholarship since they both mobilize knowledge, performance and technologies to engage broader publics.\nMy training in education, journalism and history taught me the importance of consistently looking for better strategies to communicate ideas, tell compelling stories and help foster conversations.\nWith its training and knowledge-mobilization activities, the program will provide me with an essential toolset to share my research findings \u2014 in a variety of forms, forums and languages \u2014 both within and beyond the Concordia community.\nMaya Hey\nCommunications Studies\nCan you describe your research?\nFermentation is a transformational process, changing food materials and their meanings. How could fermentation mediate (and remediate) relationships between humans and microbes to change the way we think about living collectively?\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nWe all need to eat. Yet, the politics of food knowledge are such that those with privileged access to information can wield their expertise as being truer than others. I see myself as a mediator who facilitates discussions across different sectors and audiences. As a Public Scholar, my hope is to inspire the everyday eater to lead their own food endeavors and seek their own food truths in order to change the way we think about food.\nYounes Medkour\nBiology\nCan you describe your research?\nMy project aims to understand the biological mechanisms through which the natural extract from the bark of the white willow tree extends longevity and delays the onset of age-related diseases.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nSince my research has implications for every human, I believe that it is my moral responsibility to engage with the community at large about the opportunities and challenges, and the philosophical, societal and economic impacts, of extending healthy human life. Through its training and activities, the Public Scholars program would allow me to attain this objective. It will allow me to transfer my knowledge to the community so that we can address one of the world\u2019s biggest mysteries: aging.\nMilan Valyear\nPsychology\nCan you describe your research?\nI study brain mechanisms and the cues that make us want to drink alcohol. Using an animal model, I can manipulate defined neural circuits that underlie this effect.\nHow will this program be of benefit?\nIt can be difficult to explain complicated analyses simply and clearly while maintaining a necessary degree of nuance. Some science journalists seem to do this effortlessly. This program will allow me to develop the skills that I admire in my favourite journalists. I intend to use this opportunity to make my own research, and the work of my peers, accessible and available to a wider audience.\nAttend a special Concordia Public Scholars Program event on March 20 . The inaugural cohort will share, in five minutes or less, why their research matters to society. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},

People of all ages and backgrounds gather to learn, share, make and get inspired at Maker Faires around the world, from Beijing to Orlando, Fla., and from Rio de Janeiro to Hyderabad, India.\nConcordia is hosting a local edition \u2014 the Montreal Mini Maker Faire \u2014 on November 16 and 17, 2018, in the atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building).\nThe family-friendly show-and-tell event will feature the work of more than 50 tech enthusiasts, crafters, tinkerers, hobbyists, scientists and artists. Their inventions run the gamut from life-sized replicas of Star Wars droids and electronic table-top game demos to homemade synthesizers and high-powered rocket models.\nBart Simon , associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and director of Concordia\u2019s Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology , is co-producer of the Mini Maker Faire along with Ann-Louise Davidson , associate professor in the Department of Education , and Lynn Hughes, Department of Studio Arts professor emerita.\nSimon notes that the event aligns perfectly with the university\u2019s strategic priorities to double our research and get your hands dirty .\n\u201cThe maker movement is where art, education and technology converge. Our university is also a unifier of cross-disciplinary initiatives,\u201d says Simon.\n\"This event is about more than creating a showcase for makers around Montreal. As society shifts at an ever-increasing pace, maker culture becomes critical as a movement, a set of practices and shared values for taking control over the technologies that define us. This kind of critical making is the new liberal arts for the 21st century and with this event, Concordia puts itself front and centre in the debate about what universities can become.\"\nAnn-Louise Davidson (pictured centre): \u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d\nMaker culture is everywhere\nDavidson , who also holds the Concordia University Research Chair in Maker Culture, says that with two unique on-campus maker spaces, as well as several subject-matter experts, Concordia has emerged as a leader in maker culture.\n\u201cMaker spaces, such as the Technology Sandbox in the Webster Library and our Education Makers Space at Milieux, have traditional tools \u2014 hammers, saws and solders \u2014 along with emerging tech equipment such as 3D printers. And with this new gear comes an innovative way of learning.\u201d\nDavidson notes that the maker movement helps people build 21st-century skills by empowering them to respond to the world around them and create their own \u2014 mostly technology-based \u2014 inventions.\n\u201cMaker culture is everywhere,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt embodies do-it-yourself tinkering \u2014 which refers to making small changes to something to improve it \u2014 using affordable open-source computers, electronics and recycled items.\u201d\nAs an example, Davidson explains that instead of purchasing a 3D printer for the Milieux maker space, she created a community of practice to develop the expertise to build their own printers stating that the whole spirit of maker culture is to create, share, remix and connect.\n\u201cThrough making, we learn invaluable life lessons, engage in persistent, complex problem-solving and create solutions to real-world problems.\u201d\nDavidson is holding a public symposium about her research on November 18, during Concordia\u2019s inaugural Conference on Maker Cultures , which directly follows the fair.\n\u201cI want to give everyone maker fever!\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe Maker Faire is the thing to do in November in Montreal. Revealing our creativity, our ingenuity, our collaboration skills and our capacity for inclusion, it positions Concordia as a leader in the local maker ecosystem. We welcome every tinkerer, geek, inventor, creator, DIYer and even the curious.\u201d\nFrom model airplanes to mushroom roots\nThe 50-plus inventors displaying their work at the Montreal Mini Maker Faire includes five Concordians.\nBora Bodur , a master\u2019s student in educational technology, is bringing his large model airplane built entirely from 3D printed parts.\nNathalie Duponsel ,\u00a0a PhD student in educational technology, is showing projects that she created as part of the Chalet Kent makerspace project, a partnership that aims to develop a community of makers with Maison des Jeunes and help children become successful in a competitive world through STEAM activities.\nTh\u00e9o Chauvirey , a master\u2019s student in design and computation arts, is displaying the potential of mycelium (mushroom roots) in public transport design, as well as a dress produced with bacterial cellulose and embedded 3D printed patterns.\nMatthew Silverstein , a mechanical engineering student in the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, is showing a 3D printer he built, as part of a team, out of a milk crate, called the Milkcreator.\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9ger , an instructor in the John Molson School of Business, is presenting an open-source large format 3D printer that he assembled.\nAnd while on campus, why not check out the What is Food? show in Concordia\u2019s new 4th SPACE venue, which offers plenty of its own maker-related activites: raising crickets, growing food indoors, preparing vegan cheese, and testing the sugar content of homemade kombucha.\nDon\u2019t miss the Montreal Mini Maker Faire , taking place on November 16 and 17, 2018, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Abe and Harriet Gold Atrium of Concordia\u2019s Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 Ste.

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

Toutefois, l\u2019Universit\u00e9 peut \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion ou conserver et utiliser comme pr\u00e9vu le bien, ou proc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa vente afin de toucher le produit de celle-ci.\nUn re\u00e7u pour don de bienfaisance est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 votre intention; son montant refl\u00e8te la juste valeur marchande, \u00e0 la date du don, du bien c\u00e9d\u00e9. La valeur des obligations et des actions cot\u00e9es en bourses se fixe ais\u00e9ment; par contre, celle de tout bien mat\u00e9riel estim\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 1\u00a0000\u00a0$ doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par un \u00e9valuateur qualifi\u00e9. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ce dernier ne doit avoir de liens ni avec vous ni avec l\u2019Universit\u00e9. S\u2019il y a lieu, vous prenez en charge la totalit\u00e9 des frais d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Enfin, si la valeur du bien c\u00e9d\u00e9 est estim\u00e9e \u00e0 moins de 1\u00a0000\u00a0$, celui-ci peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par une personne qualifi\u00e9e occupant un poste \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9.\nSoulignons que les r\u00e8gles qui gouvernent les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour dons en esp\u00e8ces s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement aux dons en nature.\nBiens \u00e0 valeur accrue\nToute valeur mobili\u00e8re ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re, ainsi que tout bien mat\u00e9riel, que vous offrez en don a probablement pris de la valeur depuis son acquisition. En vertu de la l\u00e9gislation fiscale actuelle, quand vous c\u00e9dez \u00e0 un organisme charitable un bien \u00e0 valeur accrue, vous \u00eates r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir touch\u00e9 un produit \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 sa juste valeur marchande. De fait, le re\u00e7u d\u2019imp\u00f4t que vous obtenez est \u00e9tabli en fonction de la valeur accrue du bien \u2013 et non pas de la somme que vous avez d\u00e9bours\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine. Tout gain en capital r\u00e9alis\u00e9 est alors impos\u00e9 \u00e0 hauteur de 50 %.\nBiens culturels\nDans les ann\u00e9es 1970, le gouvernement du Canada a adopt\u00e9 la Loi sur l\u2019exportation et l\u2019importation de biens culturels. D\u2019une part, il souhaitait pr\u00e9server les tr\u00e9sors artistiques nationaux, par exemple des \u0153uvres de peintres canadiens ou des meubles artisanaux. D\u2019autre part, il voulait inciter les donateurs \u00e0 l\u00e9guer de telles richesses \u00e0 des organismes canadiens.\nL\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada offre des encouragements fiscaux additionnels aux donateurs de biens culturels. Outre un re\u00e7u pour don de bienfaisance \u00e9tabli selon la juste valeur marchande du bien c\u00e9d\u00e9, ces derniers peuvent en effet r\u00e9clamer, pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, la totalit\u00e9 (100\u00a0%) de leur don \u2013 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de leur revenu net. Par ailleurs, si le bien s\u2019est appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 depuis son acquisition, le gain en capital n\u2019est pas imposable.\nLes \u00e9conomies d\u2019imp\u00f4t s\u2019annoncent donc substantielles. Par exemple, si le bien culturel c\u00e9d\u00e9 est \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 100\u00a0000\u00a0$, elles pourraient totaliser \u2013 paliers provincial et f\u00e9d\u00e9ral confondus \u2013 45\u00a0000\u00a0$ ou 50\u00a0000\u00a0$, suivant le taux d\u2019imposition provincial auquel vous \u00eates assujetti. Encore une fois, le gain en capital n\u2019est pas imposable.\nNous poss\u00e9dons deux\u00a0d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de biens culturels permanents de classe \u00ab\u00a0A\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0: la Galerie Leonard-et-Bina-Ellen, qui se consacre \u00e0 l\u2019art contemporain canadien, ainsi que les Biblioth\u00e8ques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Concordia.

The Student Health and Wellbeing Review outlines a series of recommendations that will touch on all aspects of curriculum, student service operations and university policy and reflects Concordia\u2019s ongoing transformation into a next-generation university.\nIn the fall of 2017, Concordia\u2019s president Alan Shepard requested a formal review on student health and wellbeing at Concordia in response to an increase in the number of students requiring assistance for mental and physical health, as well as the ever-changing dynamics of student life on campus.\nThe university appointed an eight-person committee consisting of staff, students and senior leadership to conduct the review.\n\u201cAs a next-generation university with significant research expertise in preventive health, this process was an important exploration of how Concordia can build on its strengths,\u201d says Lisa Ostiguy , special advisor to the provost on Campus Life and committee co-chair.\n\u201cOur mandate was to create a blueprint that will infuse prevention and wellbeing into the core of our academic operations and services.\u201d\nA collaborative process\nThe review committee was guided by a process that engaged the Concordia community through Idea Caf\u00e9s, as well as interviews with subject matter experts from Concordia and broader Montreal, an environmental scan of North American universities and feedback from directors across Concordia\u2019s student services.\nFollowing the assessment of all of the internal and external data, several priorities emerged to enhance the health and wellbeing of Concordia\u2019s students.\nEach recommendation is infused with preventive health principles and demonstrates an effort to bring these principles to Concordia\u2019s services and operations through practical initiatives that have been prioritized by Concordians.\nThe seven priority areas are:\nCurriculum and training\nSupporting services for student health and wellbeing\nHealth communications\nSpaces where Concordians can meaningfully connect\nPolicy and procedures\nStudent engagement\nCreating a culture and community that supports student health and wellbeing\nFor Gaya Arasaratnam , committee co-chair and director of Campus Wellness and Support Services , the report is a remarkable community effort that reflects the character of Concordia.\n\u201cConcordians care deeply about the wellbeing of all our students and to maximize this will require a common effort. The feedback and recommendations put forward are\u00a0 a wonderful first step to significant changes on campus.\u201d\nNext moves\nAlready two key initiatives from the report\u2019s recommendations are in fruition.\nThe first is the development of an embedded advisor wellness program poised to set a new standard in campus mental-health services in fall 2019. This initiative was made possible through a generous donation by the Rossy Foundation .\nIn addition, Concordia will adopt the Okanagan Charter that was developed by 380 researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policymakers from 45 countries as Concordia works towards the goal of embedding health and wellness into the everyday operations of universities and colleges.\nConcordia is also the first Quebec university to adopt the charter and join the network of Canadian Health Promoting Campuses , which aims to engage higher education institutions to advance the health-promoting universities and colleges movement within Canada.\nA concrete five-year action plan has been put in place to carry out the recommendations of the Health and Wellness and will be overseen by Ostiguy.\nConsult Concordia\u2019s Health and Wellbeing Review \u00a0for complete details on the review process, findings, recommendations and priorities, as well as the action plan going forward.\n\u00a0\n"},

And this summer at Concordia\u2019s Centre for Technoculture, Art and Games (TAG), the Critical Hit games program is on target for 10 intense weeks of innovative and experimental video-game development.\n\u201cWe called the program Critical Hit because we are serious about making playable games with the community and not just as part of academic research,\u201d says Bart Simon, Department of Sociology and Anthropology associate professor and TAG director. \u201cBut we also wanted people to know that TAG is where the critical hit happens \u2014 a place where cultural critique and critical design are combined in the innovation of game mechanics and content.\u201d\nThe objective of the Critical Hit program, which runs from June 17 to August 23, is to foster open communication, collaboration and creativity among the next generation of game designers.\nDecode Global\u2019s Get Water! game promotes the message that water scarcity is one of the main reasons Indian girls miss out on school. | Image courtesy of Decode Global\n\u201cGames can be used as an effective method of storytelling, and are a good medium for the exploration of social and political issues,\u201d says program coordinator Angelique Mannella. \u201cConcordia is already known as a leader in game studies and design, but Critical Hit has widened the space for innovation and collaboration.\u201d\nCritical Hit is organized by TAG and Montreal\u2019s Dawson College in conjunction with Hexagram-Concordia and Decode Global, a company that specializes in mobile games for social impact. The program\u2019s mission this year is to develop video games \u201cfor social change\u201d from an early prototype stage to a more finished state \u2014 a playable prototype of sorts.\nThe program is open to emerging media artists, designers and programmers \u2014 particularly recent graduates or those finishing up their studies in game development \u2014 who have a game prototype. Program mentors were recruited from both the Concordia community and Montreal gaming industry.\n\u201cCritical Hit is the next step in a game developer\u2019s education \u2014 applying what you\u2019ve learned at school and moving past prototypes and studies,\u201d says Simon.\nLynn Hughes, associate professor in the Department of Studio Arts and co-founder of TAG, adds that Critical Hit\u2019s emphasis on innovative approaches to games that address contemporary social, cultural and political concerns is partly in response to the current unbridled enthusiasm for \u201cgamification.\u201d\n\u201cThe notion of gamification suggests that dressing up almost anything with a superficial game mechanic makes it more palatable,\u201d she explains. \u201dWe\u2019re looking for games that do more than this and address social impact in new, interesting and substantial ways.\u201d\nPublic presentation of games created during 2011\u2019s Montreal Games Incubator | Image courtesy of the Centre for Technoculture, Art and Games\nMannella, who is also founder and CEO of Decode Global, explains that TAG has \u201cincubated\u201d video games before: in 2011, at the university\u2019s Montreal Games Incubator, where four successful games were presented to the public at the end of the program; and in 2012, when Mannella brought to Concordia her own game, Get Water!, so graduate students could obtain real-life development experience. However, Critical Hit is the first time a laboratory has been created to nurture collaborative games.\n\u201cThe space that Concordia and TAG provide for games for social change is different than what a for-profit can provide. And in Montreal, with its unique gaming industry, Concordia is the perfect place for research and development to align,\u201d she says.\nSimon concurs: \u201cThere\u2019s such a great indie game development scene in this city; people want to create interesting, low-cost games. Universities can handle more risk than business, so really innovative games can be created in a safe and inclusive space.\u201d\nThe 2013 edition of Critical Hit is funded by the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation, du Loisir et du Sport\u2019s Programme de collaboration universit\u00e9s-coll\u00e8ges (or Chantier 3), where the province\u2019s post-secondary institutions are encouraged to collaborate.\nRelated links:\n"}
