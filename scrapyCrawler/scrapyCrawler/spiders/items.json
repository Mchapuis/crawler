See About , Scope , Funding , Eligibility , Application and instructions , Selection criteria , and Deadline sections for more information.\nAbout\nConcordia University is one of Canada's most dynamic universities in one of North America's most livable cities. It reflects a unique blend of commitments to diversity, accessibility, social responsibility, and innovation. With over 45,000 students (7,439 international) and over 2,000 full-time and part-time professors, Concordia is recognized for offering a rich academic experience combined with strong community engagement.\nThis is a time of change for Concordia University Library. A major renovation and expansion project recently transformed the Webster Library at the Sir George Williams Campus (downtown), and plans to renovate the Vanier Library at the Loyola campus will soon be underway.\nWith a team of 120 librarians, professionals and support staff who put student and faculty success at the centre of their practice, the Library collaborates to achieve the goals outlined in our strategic plan . Some of the highlights from the plan's goals and objectives include:\nThe transformation of service offerings to provide an outstanding user experience\nThe launch of the Concordia University Press to disseminate engaging research in the form of open access scholarly books\nThe creation of a platform for the preservation and dissemination of oral history material\nThe promotion of research and innovation in library and information studies\nIn light of this, the Concordia Library Researcher-in-Residence program was created to promote conducting research in the library and the use of research by practitioners. The program offers the opportunity for librarians, archivists, scholars, or doctoral students to focus on an area of inquiry in a supportive and enriching environment, and to interact with Concordia Library staff and resources.\nThe presence of the Researcher-in-Residence in Concordia Library has as one of its goals to foster a culture of research. It is hoped that throughout the residency, both the researcher and staff will become engaged in the use of research in library practice and the concept of evidence-based librarianship.\nThe residency period is from January 1 to December 1, 2019. Proposals which include alternative start dates and those of different duration will also be considered.\nThe Researcher-in-Residence program began in January 2017 and Concordia has welcomed two researchers since then.

For the 2019 Researcher-in-Residence program, Concordia Library invites proposals relating to any of the Library's strategic plan goals as well as the following themes:\nThe role of the library in a next-generation university\nThe role of the library in the digital humanities\nCollection development in an increasingly connected world\nUse of space for learning and research\nDigital  libraries\nCommunication  and outreach to users\nOpen educational resources\nEfficacy of library instruction\nProfessional development and capacity building of library staff\nResearchers and practitioners from library and information studies, as well as other disciplines (e.g., anthropology, computer science, education, informatics, media studies, sociology) are welcome to apply.\nScope\nAs part of  the program, Concordia Library will provide:\nDedicated workspace in Concordia  Library\nAccess to computing facilities\nAccess to library resources, print and electronic collections, and technological infrastructure\nOpportunities for the  Researcher-in-Residence to interact with Concordia Library staff\nOther types of in-kind support may  be made available\nIn return, the Researcher-in-Residence is expected to participate in the intellectual life of Concordia Library.
