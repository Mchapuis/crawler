Borrowing from the American model, municipal governments have played a role by promising all residents access to municipal services without fear. But unlike their American counterparts, Canadian cities and the federal government are not locked in overt political and legal conflicts over jurisdiction i.e. the authority to govern migration. On the one hand, the federal government has no official policy on sanctuary; on the other hand, cities have avoided contesting presumptions about the capacity of the federal government to project enforcement power at the local level. Nowhere is this more evident than the role of local authorities in the collection and sharing of information with the Canada Border Services Agency. At the same time, there is limited dialogue among local, provincial or federal governments about the role of cities in the governance of migration.  This presentation will review instances of conflict and cooperation between local and federal authorities in Canadian sanctuary cities. Using Toronto as a case study, it will survey the conceptual relationship between sanctuary and jurisdiction and question the nature and vitality of policies that avoid conflict over the authority to govern migration. Special attention will be paid to the collection and protection of information from the incongruous standpoints of service delivery and border enforcement.  The event is free and open to the public.   L'\u00e9v\u00e8nement est gratuit et ouvert \u00e0 tous.

Over the next six months, our Faculty of Fine Arts is actively connecting with faculty, staff and students, along with colleagues from Facilities Management, to collaboratively identify needs and desires for the future.\nMandate\nPresently, the university as a whole is evaluating different alternatives to address future space needs in the next ten years, related to the projection of enrolment growth. The expansion and transformation of facilities is planned according to the Strategic Directions of the university. For the elaboration of a Master space plan for Concordia University for 2018-2028, a thorough space analysis of all the Faculties, including Fine Arts, is required.\nPhase 1 (October 2018 to January 2019)\nThe first phase mainly encompasses consultation with internal and external constituents; research, documentation and analysis of data on existing space; comprehensive overview of research and teaching activities within FoFA; presentation of teaching and research trends in the fields of art, arts-based scholarship, performance, and design in higher education. The objective is to obtain a portrait of the space utilisation by FoFA and to start to articulate the vision of the facilities required in the larger context of the development of university facilities.\nAnalysis of the existing space inventory for FoFA, related to space categories, as per the Ministry of Education and Higher Education space norm.\nStudy of project precedents for significant art, design and architecture schools\nComprehensive tour of existing facilities to record \u201clived experience\u201d of usage in relation to data-driven analysis; documentation of unexpected \u201cspace hacks\u201d and improvisatory interstitial activities\nOrganisation of the following consultation activities, with compilation and analysis of data, production of meeting notes, in collaboration with key people from FoFA and Facilities Management:\nFollow-up survey on appreciation of facilities by the FoFA students, faculty, and staff (the Faculty has performed an initial survey in 2018) with the collaboration with the Supervisor of Academic and Research Facilities in the Office of the Dean and University Communications Services.\n\u00a0Multiple group discussions and departmental visits with FoFA students, faculty and staff and other guests on space planning topics related to the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 university strategic directions.\nPhase 2 (January 2019 to April 2019)\nThe second phase includes the specification of the space needs and the production of a detailed functional space program.\n\u00a0Production of a detailed space list\n\u00a0Space scenario\nDescription of key spaces (sense of space)\nIllustrated description of space types\nSchematic illustration of the space organisation and design intentions\nSpeculative synergy diagrams for internal and external collaboration\nbetween program areas \u00a0\nProcess\nConsultation, compilation and analysis of activities undertaken by the Faculty of Fine Arts will take place in three formats:\nIDEALABS\nThree open Idealabs were conducted in October and November that cut across different thematics: Experimental Pedagogy, Research Creation, and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math). Over two dozen presenters and over 100 participants assembled in different venues across the Fine Arts to hear about current activity in the Faculty. These brief expositions seeded subsequent group discussions about future space configurations rooted in needs, desires, and realities. Documentation of each Idealab will soon be posted on this website.\nFIELDWORK\nIn early 2019 a robust \"in the field\" data gathering exercise and public dissemination project led by a team of paid student \"Rovers\" will take place. Led by MFA student Breanna Shanahan with input from Faculty mentors and architects Ana Maria Llanos of Diamond Schmitt Architects and Dominique Dumont from Concordia Facilities Management, the Fieldworkers will perform three main tasks (1) comb the Faculty to gather data about space needs, (2) focus on specific questions and spatial problematics arising from consultations to develop case study analyses, and (3) respond to and communicate publicly \"findings\" from the field using a variety of fine arts methodologies such as photo essays, zines, theatrical re-enactments, speculative fiction, documentary practices, audio or visual reflections, reflection-in-action reports, etc. Results will be presented to the community through event-based Field Reports with documentation posted on this website.\n\u00a0\nA public call for Fieldworkers will take place in November with interviews and selection confirmed by mid-December. Training, assignments, actions, field reports, and documentation will occur in January through March 2019.\nMOONSHOT\nThe final (and fun!) culmination of Faculty activity focused on collective imaginings will be a speculative design charrette in the spring hosted by a guest futurist. Moonshot will create a forum for us to imagine a Sci-Fi Faculty of the Future that pushes us to the limit of our ability to predict the unknown while still staying true to our ideals of critical practice, disciplinary depth, cross-medial exchange, social inclusion, and community engagement. What openings and closings will the far future bring? How will space, time, things, texts, and bodies be accommodated? What will knowledge look and feel like? What kind of citizens do we want to be? What kinds of architectures will support our vision?\nProfiles\n", "field": "quotes"},

And it can even impinge on a student's career: many Concordia students are not aware of the fact that under the Code of Rights and Responsibilities , they can be held responsible for a social media misstep if there is a link to university activity.\nThis means that if, for example, you tweet a threat to a classmate on a course listserv, you could be charged under the code, and depending on the content of your post, the consequences could go beyond Concordia.\nSocial media is meant to be fun.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis dissertation is comprised of three essays on issues related to the financial reporting practices of credit unions in the United States. The first essay relies on an agency theory perspective to examine the extent of earnings management in U.S. credit unions through loan loss provisions (LLP). The context of member-owned credit unions provides a different set of financial reporting incentives than the one typically found in shareholder-owned banks, thus providing an opportunity to extend earnings management research. The sample comprises U.S. credit unions above $50 million in total assets, between 2003 and 2016. Results show that credit union managers engage in income smoothing through the discretionary use of LLP to avoid earnings declines. Results also show that larger and better-capitalized credit unions engage in more earnings management, as do credit unions with a federal charter. Moreover, credit unions are driven by the incentive of merging to engage in earnings management. The findings are economically significant, and thus, relevant to policymakers contemplating new regulations since these managerial activities may place the cooperative principle at risk.\nThe second essay examines how competition affects risk-taking of a matched sample (by size and county) of banks and credit unions, and whether it affects differently credit unions and banks. Several measures of risk-taking are used in the study. The period of the study is from 2010 till 2017. First, univariate analyses are conducted to compare the risk-taking of the two types of institutions. We find that the means of the risk-taking measures do not differ significantly between banks and credit unions. Second, examining the difference in the risk-taking of credit unions and banks in a multivariate analysis, we find that banks\u2019 managers engage in riskier activities. Third, we examine the effect of competition on the risk-taking. We find that increased competition induces managers of credit unions and banks to take more risk; this finding supports the competition-fragility hypothesis. We also find that credit unions\u2019 managers take more risk than banks\u2019 managers in the presence of competition. Finally, by including the quadratic term of competition, we find that there is a non-linear relationship between competition and risk-taking. This study has public policy implications: the American Banking Association argues that public policy toward credit unions and banks should be similar due to their similarities; whereas, credit unions express their difference to protect their privilege of tax exemption.\nThe third essay attempts to identify certain traits of the target credit unions in comparison to acquiring and non-merging credit unions. The analysis is performed both qualitatively and quantitatively. First, the paper presents a clinical analysis of three cases of mergers of credit unions. Each case is analyzed from the perspective of agency theory to determine the reason of merger. The three cases illustrate how the executives and directors are seeking their own utilities at the expense of the members. Second, we aim to identify certain characteristics of target credit unions empirically by comparing a sample of acquired credit unions to a matched sample of non-merging credit unions and the acquiring credit unions. The sample comprises U.S. credit unions above $10 million in total assets that merged to expand their services between 2011 and 2017. We identified a list of ratios that are used by the NCUA for credit union assessment, a univariate analysis of variance tests for differences between the means of these ratios among the three groups (targets, acquiring, and non-merging credit unions); the means of the ratios of the three groups are statistically different. Then, factor analysis is performed to classify the major factors that explain the majority of variance. Growth, capital adequacy, asset quality, and earnings are the major ratios that differentiate between the target, acquiring, and non-merging credit unions. The paper has public policy implications; it provides the NCUA with the necessary information for the amendment of the voluntary mergers proposed rule on May 25, 2017.\nWhere\nRoom MB 14.250, John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George Williams Campus\nCost\n", "field": "quotes"},

Speakers include the Honourable Allan Rock, former Canadian Minister of Justice and Ambassador to the UN, as well as several survivors of genocide and mass atrocities, including \u00c9loge Butera, Eva Kuper and Ketty Nivyabandi.\nSpeakers:\nAllan Rock\nAllan Rock is president emeritus of the University of Ottawa and a professor in its Faculty of Law, where he teaches international humanitarian law and public and constitutional law.\nRock was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1993, and re-elected in 1997 and 2000. He served for that decade as a senior minister in the government of Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, in both social and economic portfolios. He was Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada (1993-97), Minister of Health (1997-2002) and Minister of Industry and Infrastructure (2002-03).\nHe was appointed in 2003 as Canadian Ambassador to the UN in New York during a period that involved responding to several complex regional conflicts, including those in Sri Lanka, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Darfur. He led the successful Canadian effort in New York to secure, at the 2005 World Summit, the unanimous adoption by UN member states of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing and other mass atrocities. He later served as a special envoy for the UN investigating the unlawful use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka during its civil war.\nIn 2008, Rock became the 29th president and vice chancellor of the University of Ottawa, a comprehensive university of 50,000 students, faculty and staff. The university ranks among the top 10 in Canada for research intensity, and is the largest bilingual university \u2014 French and English \u2014 in the world. He completed two terms as president in 2016.\nMost recently, Rock was a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School, associated with the program on International Law and Armed Conflict.\n\u00c9loge Butera\n\u00c9loge C. Butera is an associate fellow with the Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism at McGill's Faculty of Law and with MIGS. He is a human rights activist with an active involvement in Canadian public life, with a strong focus on human security and transitional justice issues. Butera has worked in the Canadian Parliament as a research and legislative assistant to Senator Lt. Gen. Rom\u00e9o Dallaire and as an articling student to professor Irwin Cotler P.C., O.C., Member of Parliament (Mount Royal) and former Justice Minister and Attorney General of Canada. In 2013, Butera was inducted as an honorary witness to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, where he bears witness to the harm inflicted by Canada\u2019s residential school system on generations of Indigenous Canadians. A survivor of the 1994 genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda, Butera has spoken to dozens of audiences across Canada about his experience during the genocide and the role that an informed citizenry can play in preventing future mass atrocities and genocides.\nEva Kuper\nBorn at the start of the Second World War in Warsaw, Poland, Eva Kuper survived the war by a series of miraculous events involving luck, coincidence and the courage and faith of several individuals, both family members and virtual strangers. She emigrated to Canada with her family in 1949 where she grew up \"practically Canadian\" with the history of the Holocaust always there in the background. She was educated at Sir George Williams University and Concordia, spending the major part of her work life in education and educational administration. Kuper has taught children and adults in a variety of settings from pre-school centres and schools to Vanier College and Concordia, and was principal of one branch of Jewish Peoples' and Peretz Schools. She has also led workshops on a whole range of topics dealing with human development and education. Today, Kuper is an active volunteer and sits on the board and executive of Auberge Shalom pour femmes, and volunteers her time at the Jewish General Hospital\u2019s child psychiatry department, the Montreal Holocaust Museum and Temple Emanu-El Beth Sholom.\nKetty Nivyabandi\nKetty Nivyabandi is a Burundian poet and activist for human rights, social justice and democracy. In May 2015, following president Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019s candidacy for a third and unconstitutional term in office, she launched and led a historic women-only march to the capital city's Independence Square, under brutal repression from the National Police. A severe government crackdown on dissenting voices followed, and Ketty was forced to flee from persecution.\nAs a refugee, Nivyabandi continues to raise awareness on ongoing human rights abuses in her country, particularly against women, and has led several awareness campaigns about Burundi. Nivyabandi has appeared before the Canadian House of Commons, and regularly speaks on human rights in oppressive states, freedom of expression, refugee rights and women human rights defenders.\nShe is a non-violence advocate and founding member of the Women and Girls Movement for Peace and Security, an apolitical voice advocating for women to have a front seat at the peacemaking table.\nWhere\nRoom Conference Centre , John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George Williams Campus\nCost\n", "field": "quotes"},

It can be traced back to the 1950s, when the World Data Center was developed by the International Council for Science to archive and distribute data collected during the\u00a0 International Geophysical Year \u00a0\u2014 a project involving scientific interchange between 67 countries during the Cold War.\u00a0\nToday, open data references data collected by institutions, organizations and governments that are made freely and publicly available for anyone to use and redistribute as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other restraints.\u00a0\nWhen asked what Concordia will be sharing, Fournier explains that while the initial offering is small, the intention is for the platform to grow with time.\u00a0\nBarring any confidentiality restrictions, institutional data will continue to be added to the open data platform in future. Those who wish to contribute their own are welcome to submit to the catalogue via the\u00a0open data teamat\u00a0help@concordia.ca. The cross-sector group includes individuals from the\u00a0 Concordia Library ,\u00a0 IT Services \u00a0and\u00a0 Enrolment Services .\u00a0\nThe information contained within the catalogue consists of several different data set categories: historical data, real-time data and general data sets. Each data set is provided with a timestamp so users can easily identify when the data was uploaded.\u00a0\nFrom open data to collaborative learning\n\u201cOver the years we\u2019ve received requests from students, faculty and staff alike for raw data on a variety of topics, which can be used in research or even the creation of different apps and services,\u201d Fournier says.\u00a0\nThe Concordia Library team noticed that many people seemed interested in open data, and this presented an opportunity. So they began spearheading the creation of an open data application programming interface (API) as part of the\u00a0 Webster Library Transformation Project \u00a0technology program.\u00a0\n\u201cThe opportunity was not only in providing the community with a simple platform to access desired information in a convenient way, but in creating an active and collaborative learning environment,\u201d Fournier says.\nAs a result, the project was expanded to encompass the entire university. The collected data would go back to the research and innovation community, who would then have the freedom to create and use it as they wish.\u00a0\n\u201cWe want this platform to encourage ideas and creativity, but also provide a forum for sharing information and gathering knowledge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to create an open data community.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCheck out\u00a0 Concordia\u2019s open data platform ,\u00a0 register to use the API \u00a0and get a free developer key.\nRelated topics\n", "field": "quotes"},

The initiative is a key component of Concordia\u2019s Double Our Research strategic direction.\nJean-Philippe Gauvin and Fatima Amara are two newly appointed Horizon postdoctoral fellows.\nImmigrant participation in Quebec: a quantitative portrait\nDoes the local context influence how immigrants participate in civic life in Quebec? This is the question that Jean-Philippe Gauvin will help answer with a team of researchers in the Department of Political Science .\nUnder the supervision of Antoine Bilodeau and Mireille Paquet , the team is currently working on designing and administering a province-wide survey to study and compare behavioural patterns between those born in Quebec and first-generation immigrants.\n\u201cThere is a lot of theory about immigration, but not enough of it resides in empirical facts,\u201d says Gauvin. \u201cWith this project, we\u2019re trying to reconnect theory with qualitative and quantitative data.\u201d\nGauvin is an ideal candidate for this postdoctoral position due to his expertise in studying attitudes and behaviours through quantitative models.\nPrior to his appointment at Concordia, the young researcher held a postdoctoral position at Queen\u2019s University, and before that he completed his doctoral studies at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nGauvin\u2019s interests reside in Canadian politics, political values and attitudes, and federalism. His PhD dissertation focused on Canadian intergovernmental relations and their structure. He also investigated how ideologies shape political choices.\nThe survey project, which is co-funded by the Fonds Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et Culture and the Quebec Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion , will be conducted in more than 30 localities in the province, including 18 neighbourhoods of Montreal. It will map how immigrants \u00a0participate in the host community and their ethnic communities, depending on their neighbourhood of residence.\n\u201cThis has never been done before anywhere in the world,\u201d says Gauvin. \u201cHow does an immigrant\u2019s social bubble develop? What makes them active citizens?\u201d\nThe conclusions will help researchers understand the structuring effect of societal factors on immigrants\u2019 participation in Quebec, most specifically with regards to six dimensions of participation: economic, cultural, community, linguistic, identity and civic participation.\nThe set of data collected will also be useful in identifying core values among Quebecers and will feed the body of research around national identity.\nData mining for more efficient and sustainable buildings\nFatima Amara works on another highly impactful project: the study of novel solar energy applications to buildings and infrastructure.\nThe research is piloted by Andreas Athienitis , professor in the Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering and NSERC/Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Industrial Research Chair in Optimized Operation and Energy Efficiency toward High Performance Buildings.\nIt aims to understand how to integrate solar panels into buildings in order to make them more resilient and zero energy. The project operates under the Centre for Zero Energy Building Studies .\nAmara was trained as a telecommunications engineer in her home country of Algeria. While completing a master\u2019s-level stage at Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, working on the topic of residential energy consumption, she found a new interest for building engineering.\nShe then decided to move to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to pursue her doctorate. There, she worked on a hands-on problem that affects us all: energy management in Quebec homes. The project was undertaken in close partnership with industry stakeholders (in this case Hydro-Quebec), which was a big draw for Amara.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been connected to nature. I know now that I want to work in a field that is related to environmental questions. Having an impact is very important for me as a researcher,\u201d she says.\nWhy is data important for building and environmental engineering?\n\u201cCivil and mechanical engineering don\u2019t necessarily deal with what happens inside buildings, with how their occupants interact with them,\u201d Amara explains. This is where her specialty in signal processing comes in.\n\u201cA building is like a patient. The data I gather helps me diagnose the problems. I then hand my knowledge to building and mechanical engineers, who act more like the surgeons.\u201d\nUsing machine learning and artificial intelligence, she is able to add a statistical data-analytical dimension to a building, from which she pulls important clues regarding the behaviours of both occupants and buildings.\n\u201cIs it a problem of overheating, of isolation? We\u2019re trying to find out the causes,\u201d adds Amara.\nIn terms of energy consumption, the data gathered will help on two planes: the dweller, who will end up paying and consuming less, and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, who often experiences peaks in consumption and needs to outsource electricity during periods of high demand.\nThe end goal is to complement the current hydroelectrical offer with a sustainable \u2014 in this case, solar \u2014 energy source. The result will make dwellers more independent with their energy consumption and remove some of the pressure from governmental providers.\nLearn more about Concordia\u2019s Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.\n\u00a0\n", "field": "quotes"},

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThe extreme climate and remoteness of Inuit communities bring unique challenges to sustainable living. Homelessness and housing shortages are still common, underlining the need for the construction of durable, sustainable, and affordable housing. The building envelope is highly susceptible to moisture damage and deterioration if not well designed and constructed, especially in the Arctic. This thesis focuses on the heat, air, and moisture performance of structural insulated panels (SIPs) and attics in Arctic climates.\nA full-scale SIP test hut with an attic is constructed in an environmental chamber. Eight types of SIP joints were monitored with thermocouples, with at least 6 thermocouples per joint. The SIPs were subjected to temperature differences of up to 62 \u00baC and pressure differences up to 15 Pa. The attic of the test hut is divided into two bays, one is unvented and the other is ventilated mechanically. Imposed external temperature conditions reflect typical conditions observed in Inuit communities, and small pumps are used to deliver controlled rates of air leakage from the indoor space to the attics. The attic bays are monitored with temperature, relative humidity, and moisture content sensors.\nUsing hygrothermal simulation software WUFI Plus, a model is developed and verified with the experimental results. The model is then used to simulate the performance of attics utilizing various ventilation strategies, including unvented and novel building integrated photovoltaic/thermal system (BIPV/T) ventilation methods, subjected to climatic conditions of three Inuit communities. The BIPV/T system uses solar energy to generate electricity while preheating outdoor air for attic ventilation. Various rates of air leakage are applied to examine the sensitivity of the attics under each ventilation strategy. Mold index is used to evaluate the long-term performance and suitability of each strategy.\nIt is found that while SIPs can be insulating and airtight, they are most susceptible to air leakage and moisture damage at the joints since they rely heavily on adhesive tape to prevent air movement. Complex joints where three panels meet are more leaky than joints where two panels meet. These joints are also more difficult to seal with tape. Joints above the neutral pressure plane are especially vulnerable to moisture damage since indoor air tends to exfiltrate through those joints.\nAttics in Arctic climates can avoid mold growth with ventilation rates as low as 1 ACH, whether provided naturally or mechanically. Unvented attics are risky, though they can perform well if air leakage rates are minimized. Also, diffusion vents improve the performance of unvented attics significantly. BIPV/T mechanical ventilation can dramatically improve attic hygrothermal performance while generating useful electrical and thermal energy, even at very high latitudes.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nCost\n", "field": "quotes"},

Remember, many infections cause no symptoms, especially in the early stages, but they can still cause irreversible damage, such as infertility. Health professionals recommend that STI testing be done every year if you are in a stable monogamous relationship, and every 6 months if you are not. Don't forget that even though testing is a an important part of taking care of your health, there are many ways to reduce the risk of getting and spreading an STI, including using a condom and other safer sex practices .\nYou can discuss any issue related to safer sex with the nurse or the doctor. Education and prescriptions can also be provided for birth control options. STI testing is a great opportunity to discuss your vaccine status with the nurse.

Whether I\u2019m feeling heartbroken, deliriously happy or just simply bored, it\u2019s the one thing I do that makes me feel most like myself. It\u2019s the reason I decided to pursue a BA in journalism and political science at Concordia.\nI was bitten by the creative bug at an early age. I always knew that I would use my love of writing not only to make a living but also try and make the world a better place. I figured I could combine my passions to try and right/write the wrongs of the world and help create a more just place.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it at the time \u2014 yet that bite would drastically alter my life and even threaten the thing I love most: writing.\u201d\nUnknown to me, however, was that I was bitten by another kind of bug as well \u2014 a tick \u2014 when I was around 10 years old, at my grandfather\u2019s cottage in the Montpellier, Que., region.\nI didn\u2019t realize it at the time \u2014 the bite mark was on my forehead and I thought it was a pimple, to be honest. Yet that bite would drastically alter my life and even threaten the thing I love most: writing.\nI was diagnosed with Lyme disease in June 2017, more than 30 years after getting bitten by a tick infested with the\u00a0Borrelia burgdorferi\u00a0bacteria. During that time I went from being a healthy kid to a sick young lady to a gravely ill woman.\nI won\u2019t get into the lengthy list of symptoms I experienced on a near daily basis, but some of the most challenging\u00a0included chronic fatigue, recurring infections, pain and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as depression and anxiety. Over the years I often wondered how much longer I could go on living with whatever was making me so sick that I found it nearly impossible to get out of bed on most days.\nWhen I was finally diagnosed after years of seeing doctors who told me absolutely nothing was wrong with me, everything became clear \u2014 including why I hadn\u2019t been able to hold down a job in the field that I loved so much.\nI consider myself extremely lucky to have found a doctor who took the time to get to know me and my case, and who had me take the necessary immunology tests.\nThanks to that doctor I not only found out that I have Lyme but also discovered that I had experienced a stroke, which explained why I was having such a tough time remembering things and, most importantly, writing.\nKnowledge, as I learned in journalism school, is power, and finding out that I have Lyme was one of the best things \u2014 if not the best thing \u2014 that\u2019s ever happened to me. Since getting my official diagnosis I\u2019ve used the tools I learned at Concordia, like conducting interviews and doing research, to try and get healthy again.\nThere are no doctors in Quebec considered \u201cLyme literate\u201d by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society. I\u2019ve therefore had to rely on myself since getting my diagnosis. So far homeopathy and Reiki treatments have helped me the most, as well as trying to eliminate as much stress as possible from my life. Becoming a freelance writer allows me to pursue my passion without being bound by the daily grind of a regular job.\nI still want to change the world, though, as well as make it a better place. I envision a book about my personal struggle with the disease in my future and, if I\u2019m lucky enough to make it happen, I\u2019ll have writing and everything I learned at Concordia to thank.\nThey say that sometimes what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. Since being diagnosed, I\u2019ve faced the darkest parts of myself and confronted some of my biggest demons, so I know it has for me.\n#CUalumni\n", "field": "quotes"},

Other planned gifts, such as charitable gift annuities, can provide life-long income to a donor.\nWhat is an endowment?\nA gift everlasting\nAn endowment is a gift, made in your lifetime or bequeathed in your will, which provides a never-ending source of income to Concordia University. It differs from other types of contributions in that it remains actively invested, allowing the university to draw on it in perpetuity. Financial support is drawn from the income generated by the initial donation and allocated according to the donor\u2019s specifications. The principal remains untouched.\nAn enduring tribute\nEach endowment carries the name of the person or persons for whom it is established. An endowment is a very special and meaningful way to create a permanent remembrance for a loved one, or ensure that your own long-term philanthropic goals will be fulfilled. Funds are used solely for the purpose designated.\nI have planned to leave Concordia a bequest in my will. Should I do something now?\nYes!

Here is a tangible way to double our research \u2014 one of our strategic directions. This will definitely put Concordia on the map.\u201d\n31 new research opportunities\nThe Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are two-year positions, with an annual salary of $47,500 plus benefits. This is the start of an ongoing program, with 25 postdoctoral fellowships earmarked annually moving forward.\nThe priority is to recruit new postdoctoral fellows to the university, tapping into the deep pool of eligible talent across Quebec, Canada and internationally.\nGrowing the postdoc community\n\u201cSome of the best talent out there is at the postdoc stage,\u201d says Graham Carr , VP Research and Graduate Studies. \u201cThe new postdocs are great for Concordia because they let us recruit young researchers nationally and internationally, across a wide range of disciplines and departments. It has always been a priority and an aspiration to grow our postdoc community, inspired by the University of Calgary \u2019s successful strategy.\u201d\nThe new Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships do not replace the existing postdoc fellowships at Concordia; they simply expand the offering. The application deadline is October 31, but it\u2019s an open process, with ongoing assessment and selection throughout the summer and fall \u2014 in other words, don\u2019t wait.\nPrimed for post-doctoral contributions\nThe impact of the projects arising from these new positions is expected to be significant.\nSteven High, a professor in the Department of History and founding member of the Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling , is one of the program\u2019s supervisors.\nHe says the Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowship in Web Mapping and Oral History will contribute to a project charting the life stories of survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\u201cIt will help us in the development of a new digital tool that will enable us to map narrated experiences, both individually and collectively,\u201d says Steven High, one of the program\u2019s supervisors.\n\u201cThose displaced by the violence in Rwanda (both in 1994 and in the waves of anti-Tutsi violence beforehand) were forced to live in neighbouring countries.

Employers like specific questions about the nature of the job, the company\u2019s plans and goals, and the nature of the position you're being interviewed for.\n\"Tell me about yourself\"\nEmployers ask this question for a number of reasons. They might want to see how well the candidate can express themselves, they might want to gage your personality or to know important information about you. Treat this as an open-ended question that could lead to specific questions later. Instead of talking about your childhood, family or personal ambitions, keep it professional. Mention specific accomplishments that show your abilities and determination to succeed in the position. Your answers should tell the employer why you would be an asset to the company, not why you need a job.\nIf you want the job, ask for it\nMany employers feel that a strong desire for the position is just as important as your ability to do the job. A very effective interviewing technique is to simply ask for the job. One way to do this is to ask the employer if they see you performing the job. If the answer is yes, say \u201cGreat! When can I start?\u201d\nSalary reality\nAn employer might bring up the salary question in an interview. If they ask how much you are looking for, a safe response would be \u201cI\u2019m very interest in the position, I\u2019d like to earn as much as I am qualified to earn. How much would you offer a candidate with similar qualifications?\u201d If the employer makes a firm offer and you want the job, you can accept on the spot. If you\u2019re doubtful or undecided, ask for a day to think about it. Never refuse any offer of employment until you have had time to think about it.\nCommon interview questions\nEmployers often ask common questions. Find out what they are, why they ask them, and what they're looking for.\nQ. Tell me about yourself.\nThe question behind this question may be:\nAre you prepared?\nCan you organize relevant information and express it concisely?\nHow does your background relate to the job?\nSuggestions:\nKeep it brief, avoid getting into details. You can quickly cover your youth, education, work experience and present situation. Focus on the skills you have developed that are relevant to the job.\nQ. Why should I hire you?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nCan you convince me you are the right person?\nHelp me decide on the best candidate\nSuggestions:\nShow how you could solve a problem for the company by using a relevant example from your past. This will help the interviewer \u201csee\u201d you in action. If you have little experience, sell your education and give examples of situations that demonstrate your key strengths (motivation, energy, positive attitude,\u2026).\nQ. What are your major strengths?\nThe questions behind this questions may be:\nWhat important qualities and traits would you bring to this job?\nWhat is your level of maturity and self-knowledge?\nSuggestions:\nChoose from your top five self-management skills [PDF] (Qualities, Traits) those that you believe are most important for the job and the organization.\nQ. What are your major weaknesses?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nAre you aware of your weaknesses?\nWhat is your level of maturity and self-knowledge?\nCan you handle difficult questions?\nSuggestions:\nNever say you have none! Never admit a weakness that could affect your ability to do the job well. Never disclose personal issues. Choose your weakness before the interview. Limit your answer to one weakness and say what you did in order to overcome it. Overcoming a weakness is actually developing a strength.\nQ. What salary do you expect to receive?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nAre you too expensive for our budget, or would you still feel motivated with a lower pay?\nAre your expectations too low for what we wish to invest in this position?\nAre you prepared, well-informed about your market value?\nSuggestions:\nFind out in what salary range the job is situated. Never discuss salary before you receive a job offer. Mention that you trust that if an offer comes, it will be reasonable. When the interviewer insists, answer the question using a range.\nQ. What prompted your decision to apply for this position?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nDo you know what motivates you?\nHow much do you really want this job?\nDo you really understand what it takes to be successful in this job?\nWhy us? How do you know you would be happy in our organization?\nSuggestions:\nIf you apply for positions that match your true needs, this should be an easy question. Link your interest and enthusiasm to the skills and knowledge that are most relevant for the position. Mention what you like about the organization and the people who work there.\nQ. Could you please give me an example from your past that describes when you took initiative?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nShow me evidence that you have initiative\nCan you prove with facts that you really do have initiative?\nSuggestions:\nPrepare for behavioral questions by compiling key moments from your past that describe well how you handled different situations. For example, other possible behavioral questions might be:\nTell me about a great decision you made.\nWhat about a decision that proved to be a mistake?\nGive an example of a time when you handled a difficult customer.\nWhat was one of the most difficult goals you had to reach? How did you go about meeting that goal?\nQ. Where do you see yourself five years from now?\nThe question behind this question may be:\nCan we depend on you?\nAre you focused?\nCan we offer you what you really want?\nHow long do you intend to stay with this company?\nSuggestions:\nFocus on tackling the challenges within the job to which you are applying. For the longer term, you can underline how you wish to develop your career by developing new skills and knowledge that are meaningful both to you and to the organization.\n", "field": "quotes"},

Together, they vowed to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes and have since encouraged the world\u2019s wealthiest to follow suit.\nRenowned investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett, pictured with Concordia students during their November visit at his offices in Omaha, Nebraska.\nToday, more and more of the world\u2019s most affluent are joining this call to action, but you don\u2019t have to be a Buffett or a Gates to create a lasting impact.\nIncorporating a philanthropic review into your yearly planning is the first place to start. Assess your cash flow and make sure \u2014 before anything else \u2014 you pay yourself first. Consider donating some or all of your tax savings as a result.\nIf you can project this to be applicable over the next five years, then you are in a position to pledge more substantial support than you might have imagined.\nBy the time your children reach the age of adulthood, you are likely to review your estate plan to reflect this new reality. It\u2019s amazing how few people have estimated their estate\u2019s tax liability. This should be clarified and taken into account when making a decision as to whether or not to leave a legacy to charity.\nThe amount of taxes or \u201csocial capital\u201d cannot be passed on to adult children. Do you think they would be willing to forfeit some of their inheritance to put that social capital to good use towards your favourite charity? This is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Speak to your professional advisors about a plan.\nSuppose you are already established in retirement, have begun registered retirement income fund (RRIF) withdrawals, and experience a clawback on some or all of your old age security. This could be the time to begin an endowment. That way, you\u2019ll be able to see the fruits of your generosity today.\nI am often asked how to get the most out of giving. Here are three tips I recommend.\n1. Think of your favourite charity as another child. You\u2019ll find it\u2019s a deeply gratifying way to invest in something greater.\n2. Enjoy the fruits of your generosity. Take part in the benefits that come from your investments, whether it be attending events or sharing your skill set.\n3. Know how much is enough and how much is too much. Giving shouldn\u2019t be a task; know what you are able to give without having it become a burden to you and yours.\nWith a new year ahead, make your own pledge to find bold ways to give back. A planned gift empowers you to make a more significant contribution than you may think. In its design, make sure to profit from financial and tax benefits that help you fulfill your philanthropic goals.\nTo learn more, talk to your financial planner or contact me.\n#CUgiving\n", "field": "quotes"},

Figuring out how to advance a cause usually starts with a bit of introspection.\nIn the last edition of my column, I wrote about putting together a philanthropic plan . One of the six steps I recommended was: \u201cAsk yourself what kind of society you want to see.\u201d It\u2019s a thought-provoking question that leads to a better personal understanding of where to direct one\u2019s generosity.\nHugh McQueen, BEng 54, was an example of that principle in action. He was a distinguished professor emeritus at Concordia\u2019s Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. Anyone who had the pleasure of knowing the late teacher and prolific researcher could tell you of a cause he advocated strongly: sustainability.\nHugh McQueen, BEng 54, was a distinguished professor emeritus at Concordia\u2019s Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and a strong advocate of sustainability.\nOver his 50-year career at Concordia, Hugh\u2019s accomplishments included launching the university\u2019s first graduate program in engineering. Prompted by an oil embargo that caused a crisis in 1973, Hugh started to teach energy strategy. That would prove to be an important cause for the remainder of Hugh\u2019s career.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nHugh\u2019s history of giving to Concordia reflects his values. The causes the late professor championed in life continue to be supported by his legacy. As someone who was passionate about energy conservation, he gave generously to ENCS and students in the faculty. Those bright young minds, in turn, can advance our society and that cause in the next generation.\nThough Hugh passed away on December 17, 2015, he continues to shape Concordia\u2019s future. That\u2019s because he was a planned giving donor. His generosity funds the Hugh McQueen Undergraduate Scholarship in Design and Manufacturing and the Hugh McQueen Award of Excellence \u2014 both at our Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. Hugh\u2019s wife Josephine is also a committed donor. In addition to supporting Hugh\u2019s endeavours, she also sustains many different initiatives at Concordia. For the McQueens, Concordia is like family.\nThere are many planned giving options available. While Hugh made a bequest of funds to enable talented engineering students to thrive at Concordia, there are different giving options. One should always look for a win-win situation, where a donor can make a palpable difference for the future while optimizing tax savings.\nRegardless of the variety of planned gift mechanisms you choose, it will show your ongoing commitment to society and speak to your personal values.\n#CUgiving\u00a0 #CUalumni\n", "field": "quotes"},

Governments, like Canada\u2019s, are increasingly tax-friendly to donors. This support has helped make philanthropy achievable \u2014 even beneficial \u2014 to a much wider audience than before. And today\u2019s donors, from modest contributors to the Warren Buffetts, are looking to see the outcomes of their giving in their lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis has led many to consider their philanthropic plan. Much like a financial plan, a philanthropic plan can help you maximize your giving, make a greater impact on causes that are important to you and enjoy the satisfaction of witnessing your philanthropy in action.\u00a0\u00a0\nA shared experience: Raye Briscoe and husband Robert Briscoe, BSc 67, MBA 73, have made giving back a family value. They are seen here with their children and grandchildren during a 2015 celebration of their support for the John Molson School of Business.\nTo begin a philanthropic plan, here are six steps I encourage people to reflect upon:\n1.\u00a0Research organizations you may give to.\nOnce you choose a cause to support, examine the many worthy organizations working to advance that particular cause, locally, nationally or internationally. Canada has 86,000 registered charities. While this might seem overwhelming, looking into the good work carried out by our country\u2019s impressive charities can be a meaningful \u2014 even an inspiring \u2014 exercise. Ensure that you are dealing with a recognized registered charity. Find its registration number.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determine how your values are/can be expressed in your giving.\nCreate a list of charities you like or would like to support. What causes have you supported in the past that have given you the most satisfaction?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide how much you wish to give annually.\nMany people make donations when asked and are therefore not entirely aware of what it all adds up to.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ask yourself what kind of a society you would like to see?\nIt\u2019s a big question. In my experience, the answer is often connected to an individual\u2019s unique life story. What did you do in life? What did your parents do? What were the challenges you faced/overcame? Ultimately, answering this question will help define what you want your legacy to be.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once giving goals are set, choose the most effective vehicle in order to achieve them.\nThis is where planned giving expertise can be most relevant. Based on your stage in life, career or the nature of your assets, different vehicles and strategies may apply best \u2014 such as gifting securities versus cash. This will allow you to maximize your gift.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If possible, involve family.\nPhilanthropy is often a shared experience. An alumnus who recently gave to Concordia recalled taking night courses as a mature student with a young family at home. He noted his partner\u2019s and his children\u2019s sacrifices for him to earn his degree and later his career success. During his official gift announcement at Concordia, it was clear that his children and grandchildren, who were present, took great pride in the gift too.\n#CUgiving\n", "field": "quotes"},

Read about your options for part-time work as an international student and learn about the resources available to you as you begin your job search.\nWork study\nThe Work Study Program offers one option for working on-campus and carries many advantages such as having your study and work environments close to one another. If you do not speak French, there is the added bonus of working in an English language setting.\nContact the Work Study Program at 1550 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W, GM 220 or visit their website to explore this option.\nKey job search resources\nCAPS website \u2013 We recommend exploring all the tabs on this Job Search and R\u00e9sum\u00e9 page to get a full picture of your options and how to go about your search.\nHousing and Job Bank (HOJO) maintained by the Concordia Student Union (CSU).\nUpdate and adapt your r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nYou will need to create a strong and up-to-date r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that reflects r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing practices in North America.\nCAPS offers a R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Drop-in review service at 2070 Mackay to polish your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter drafts.

For templates and additional resources visit the CAPS web page about R\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters.\nLanguage requirements\nIf you do not speak French and wish to work off-campus, you may find job hunting a challenge. If you are considering staying in Quebec long-term, or just want to immerse yourself and practice speaking in French, come by the French language conversation groups at the Career Resource Centre.\nNot all employment in Quebec requires you to be bilingual in French and English. For example, working in an English-language setting such as on-campus at Concordia or at other predominantly English universities schools or organizations is one option. Below you\u2019ll find some additional suggestions.\nTips on where to look\nTeaching and Tutoring:\u00a0If you speak another language besides English, consider teaching at a language school. Find a comprehensive listing of these institutions in Montreal by looking under the heading \u201cschools language\u201d in the telephone Yellow Pages directory .\nIf you are a good student explore the option of tutoring subjects in your academic major or your language(s). Consider advertising your services in the student newspaper \u2013 The Link, posting a notice on bulletin boards around campus, or advertising on con-ads.com.\nMany elementary and secondary schools maintain lists of tutors (e.g. for subjects like math). Visit the English Montreal School Board for a complete list of English elementary and secondary schools in Montreal.\nRestaurant and Kitchen Help:\u00a0Restaurants are numerous in Montreal. To be a waiter or waitress you will need to speak French; however, kitchen jobs may not have this requirement. Check your telephone yellow page directory for a listing of restaurants and note that restaurants are listed alphabetically and by type of cuisine e.g. Indian, Italian, and Japanese. You may increase your chances of success by approaching restaurants where your language skills are an asset.\nEnglish Neighborhoods:\u00a0Areas such as Westmount, NDG, Cote St. Luc, and The West Island tend to have a larger concentration of English people than others. In these areas several streets such as Greene Ave., Monkland Blvd., and Sherbrooke St. W. that have many coffee shops and retail stores that might provide employment.\nCanadian Importers from Abroad:\u00a0Consider working for a Canadian company that imports goods into Canada from your home country. Search the \u201cCanadian Importers Database\u201d to find possible companies to approach. Check out the List of Importers by Country.\nEnglish Press and Media:\u00a0One could also approach English newspapers and publishers such as The Gazette, Reader\u2019s Digest, The Hour, Montreal Mirror, and The Suburban.\nTry English radio stations such as CJAD Radio 800, CHOM FM 97 7, Q 92.5 FM, 98.5 FM, or English television stations such as CFCF, CTV, Global Montreal etc.\nConsider contacting English language movie theatres such as AMC or Banque Scotia Montr\u00e9al. Both are within walking distance of Concordia.\nPredominantly English language bookstores in Montreal such as Chapters, Coles, Indigo, Nicholas Hoare and Paragraph might provide opportunities.\nCommunity centres:\u00a0There are many centres in Montreal that offer services to new Canadians (e.g. Hirondelle) and local ethnic groups and associations (e.g. The Greek Labor Association, Chinese Family Services, and the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre) and that may offer after school programs, language classes, arts & craft courses for seniors or children etc. where you may find part-time employment.\nFor a complete listing of organizations for immigrants and ethnic groups consult the \u201cDirectory of Community Services of Greater Montreal\u201d available in the Career Resource Centre (H-440).\nSpecialized care:\u00a0Home care workers assist people and families with special needs such as caring for children with disabilities, and helping seniors with errands/small tasks around the home. To locate jobs in this area, check CAPS website, HOJO, and classified ads in English newspapers such as the Gazette, the Suburban, and the Mirror.\nBe sure tocheck what is written on your study permit as most carry restrictions on working with children or providing medical care.\nComputer science:\u00a0If you are a computer science major or technically savvy you could explore opportunities in website design, programming and game testing/development on the CAPS website. \u00a0Consider also advertising your services on bulletin boards around campus, and on notice boards in public places like local libraries etc.\nWarehouse work:\u00a0Warehouse workers replenish stock on shelves in large wholesale stores such as UPS, Costco, Reno Dep\u00f4t or even local grocery stores and pharmacies. Check with stores in your area.\nPart-time and Summer Job Search\nLooking for a summer job or a part-time position?

As spokesperson and director of International Media Relations for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, Nancy Park, AMBA 04, will be at the centre of that gaze.\nAs spokesperson for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, Nancy Park will help welcome athletes from more than 90 countries to Korea from February 9 to 25, 2018.\nPark\u2019s tasks over the past few years have included promoting the upcoming Olympics and reporting to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on the PyeongChang Games\u2019 progress. Her role will take on new intensity during the Games\u2019 17 days, as thousands of athletes, coaches, officials, media and others from more than 90 countries arrive for the international competition.\nPyeongChang, Korea, is certainly a long way from Park\u2019s hometown of Regina, Sask. She first moved to Seoul to work in Corporate Communications at Korean Air after earning a BA in political science from the University of Regina in 1997.\nPark\u2019s interest in aviation eventually brought her back to Canada, to pursue an Aviation MBA at Concordia\u2019s John Molson School of Business (JMSB).\nShe says her time at JMSB provided important skills and experience for her career.\n\u201cThe MBA involved a lot of project work, which meant a lot of teamwork,\u201d Park says. \u201cThere were many international students, and people from around the world negotiate and collaborate differently. Studying under those circumstances provided me with the skillset that certainly helped with my current position working with international members of Olympic committees from around the world.\u201d\nPark holds fond memories of her time at Concordia and still remembers many of her professors, notably Mahesh C. Sharma , professor of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management. She also remains in touch with many of her former classmates.\nOne of the reasons she opted for the university was the wonderful things she had heard about Montreal. \u201cIf I regret one thing, it\u2019s that during my 14-month MBA I didn\u2019t have enough time to experience the city more,\u201d she says.\nAfter graduating in 2004 she returned to Korean Air. When the company\u2019s CEO Cho\u00a0Yang-ho became chair of the bid committee in 2009 for the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, Park worked with her team to promote PyeongChang as the city host.\nAfter winning the bid in 2011, Park went back to her day job at the airline. The next year she was promoted to general manager of Human Resources. Soon after she was presented with an amazing opportunity: to be part of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games Planning Committee.\nPark took on the role of spokesperson and director of International Media Relations. For the past few years she\u2019s been working non-stop with the IOC and different international federations for sport to promote the games internationally.\nMany historic firsts\nThe PyeongChang games are the first Winter Games in Asia since Nagano, Japan, played host in 1998. There will be more than 100 medal events, the most ever for the Winter Olympics, as well as a history-making attendance by North Korea.\nPark admits to being equal parts nervous and excited. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense year, but we also won the bid back in 2011, so it also feels like it\u2019s been a long-time coming,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some ways, I wish time would slow down because it\u2019s all happening so fast. I want to appreciate the moment because I recognize it for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that it is.\u201d\nWhat does Park plan to do once the games are over?\n\u201cI will return to my work at Korean Air \u2014 but first I\u2019d like to take a vacation with my daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in weeks because of my workload. I do, however, suspect I\u2019ll experience some post-Games withdrawal for a while.\u201d\nThe 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games will be held from February 9 to 25. The Paralympic Games will follow from March 8 to 18.\n#CUalumni\n", "field": "quotes"},

Governments, like Canada\u2019s, are increasingly tax-friendly to donors. This support has helped make philanthropy achievable \u2014 even beneficial \u2014 to a much wider audience than before. And today\u2019s donors, from modest contributors to the Warren Buffetts, are looking to see the outcomes of their giving in their lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis has led many to consider their philanthropic plan. Much like a financial plan, a philanthropic plan can help you maximize your giving, make a greater impact on causes that are important to you and enjoy the satisfaction of witnessing your philanthropy in action.\u00a0\u00a0\nA shared experience: Raye Briscoe and husband Robert Briscoe, BSc 67, MBA 73, have made giving back a family value. They are seen here with their children and grandchildren during a 2015 celebration of their support for the John Molson School of Business.\nTo begin a philanthropic plan, here are six steps I encourage people to reflect upon:\n1.\u00a0Research organizations you may give to.\nOnce you choose a cause to support, examine the many worthy organizations working to advance that particular cause, locally, nationally or internationally. Canada has 86,000 registered charities. While this might seem overwhelming, looking into the good work carried out by our country\u2019s impressive charities can be a meaningful \u2014 even an inspiring \u2014 exercise. Ensure that you are dealing with a recognized registered charity. Find its registration number.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Determine how your values are/can be expressed in your giving.\nCreate a list of charities you like or would like to support. What causes have you supported in the past that have given you the most satisfaction?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decide how much you wish to give annually.\nMany people make donations when asked and are therefore not entirely aware of what it all adds up to.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ask yourself what kind of a society you would like to see?\nIt\u2019s a big question. In my experience, the answer is often connected to an individual\u2019s unique life story. What did you do in life? What did your parents do? What were the challenges you faced/overcame? Ultimately, answering this question will help define what you want your legacy to be.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once giving goals are set, choose the most effective vehicle in order to achieve them.\nThis is where planned giving expertise can be most relevant. Based on your stage in life, career or the nature of your assets, different vehicles and strategies may apply best \u2014 such as gifting securities versus cash. This will allow you to maximize your gift.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If possible, involve family.\nPhilanthropy is often a shared experience. An alumnus who recently gave to Concordia recalled taking night courses as a mature student with a young family at home. He noted his partner\u2019s and his children\u2019s sacrifices for him to earn his degree and later his career success. During his official gift announcement at Concordia, it was clear that his children and grandchildren, who were present, took great pride in the gift too.\n#CUgiving\n", "field": "quotes"},

Baillet\u2019s days were now spent learning how games like Assassin\u2019s Creed go from preliminary design to finished product, a process that can be years in the making. \u201cThe software \u2014 that is, the development of software \u2014 is something I understood backwards and forwards,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the creative component was completely new to me.\u201d\nDeveloping a game means assembling a team of artists, designers and programmers in equal measure. \u201cIt was the most interesting aspect for me coming in,\u201d he says. \u201cI got to know the people, their crafts and everyone\u2019s impact on the final product.\u201d\nMaking it easy\nBaillet feels his time as VP of Human Resources was essential preparation for his current role as VP of Corporate Affairs. \u201cMy job is to make things easy for our developers so they can express their ideas, and also make it easy for the people around us to understand what we do. Today when I interact with government and various institutions, I understand where we are going as a company and where this fits in the Quebec landscape,\u201d he says.\nFrancis Baillet took part in the panel discussion \u201cInternational Competition: Why is a company moving to one location rather than another?\u201d hosted by the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations on November 21, 2017. | Photo courtesy: CORIM\n\u201cFor example, Quebec is currently making a strong commitment to artificial intelligence [AI], but it\u2019s been around in video games for 20 years. So as the research on AI and machine learning at universities gets better and better, we\u2019re able to take some of that research and use our expertise internally to improve the way players interact with the machine.\u201d\nHe sees it as the sum of two parts. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of understanding where the government, the public and institutions are headed, understanding where we are going as a company, and working to match the two so that together we create a promising future for the next generation of video game artists, designers and programmers.\u201d\nAlready a $100-billion industry worldwide, gaming is growing at about seven per cent annually, so just maintaining market share means significant growth. Yet Ubisoft aims to capture a larger piece of the pie.\n\u201cOur goal is to be a game changer for Quebec\u2019s economy of the future,\" Baillet reports. \"Last September, we announced our next growth phase in Quebec. With plans to add 1,000 jobs in the next 10 years, Ubisoft studios in Montreal, Quebec City, Piedmont [Que.] and Saguenay [Que.], which will be inaugurated this month, will be home to 4,600 creative minds by the end of 2027.\u201d\nIf at first you don\u2019t succeed\nApplying for his undergraduate studies, Baillet set his sights on Concordia with the goal of studying in the co-op program . Yet he didn\u2019t make the co-op cut right away. \u201cI decided to keep my dream alive and start at Concordia anyway,\u201d he says.\nMaria Paradiso, then head of the co-op program, was instrumental in helping him reach his goal: after the first term, Baillet\u2019s grades and a successful interview earned him a place in the program. \u201cThat was a really important moment for me,\u201d he says.\nBaillet feels the major advantage of a co-op program is the chance to explore different career possibilities before you graduate, and figure out what\u2019s best for your personality. \u201cIt was one of the best decisions I ever made.\u201d\n#CUalumni\nConcordia President\u2019s Speaker Series on Digital Futures\nAs part of Concordia President\u2019s Speaker Series on Digital Futures , Baillet will be in conversation with Robert Beauchemin, CEO of KnowledgeOne :\nTuesday, February 20\nConcordia University Conference Centre\nJohn Molson Building, 9th floor, 1450\u00a0Guy St.\nTopics they\u2019ll discuss include the intersection of gaming and learning applications and how Ubisoft is taking a role in several teaching projects in Quebec.\n", "field": "quotes"},

I came away from this trip feeling uplifted and inspired, with a new outlook on my career path.\nThe highlight of the day took place at Anthony\u2019s Steakhouse, where we were seated with students from seven other schools. I felt quite lucky to be among them as we were the only Canadian group and the only undergraduate students present.\nWhen Mr. Buffett humbly entered the room, all conversation ground to a halt.\nHe started off with a joke about Charlie Munger, his right-hand man, then opened the floor to questions, to which Mr. Buffett provided very comprehensive answers. Each response lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.\nThe discussion covered a range of qualitative, investor-related and macroeconomic topics. The first school asked him which qualities he looks for in hiring people. He said intelligence, energy and integrity, but most notably passion in what they do. He suggested that we should pursue jobs we would do even if we didn\u2019t need to work.\nI was selected to ask one of Concordia\u2019s prepared questions: \u201cIf you could restart today with $1 million, how many stocks would you buy and why?\u201d In keeping with his investing style, Mr. Buffett said he would maintain a very concentrated portfolio with only four or five stocks that he would buy at low valuations.\nThroughout the Q&A period, a few key takeaways resonated with me. Firstly, a good investor does not need a super high IQ. Rather, he or she requires a good temperament with emotional discipline.\nSecond, it\u2019s important to surround ourselves with people who we admire as we move in the direction of the company we keep. Do not put emphasis on mistakes, and when we notice a problem, act quickly.\nAnd most of all, be passionate about what we do in life. These words of wisdom are powerful enough to last a lifetime and will surely guide me in my future endeavours.\nWe ended the magical day with a journey through one of the Oriental Trading Company \u2019s fulfillment centres. It was quite a trek \u2014 wandering through this 750,000-square-foot facility. I had never before seen anything as incredible, methodical and efficient.\nI am truly grateful to Mr. Buffett for taking the time to share his knowledge, humour and wisdom, and to our program director, Reena Atanasiadis, whose devoted persistence allowed us to gain access to this unparalleled event.\nChlo\u00e9 Evans\nOur day started off with a visit to Nebraska Furniture Mart , a high-volume retailer of furniture, general supplies and electronics, and one of Berkshire\u2019s many subsidiaries.\nWe then made our way to lunch to meet with the Oracle of Omaha. He invited the attending schools in alphabetical order to question him (we were there alongside students from Boston University, Columbia University, Grinnell College, Marquette University, University of Maryland, St. Louis University and Yale University).\nA multitude of topics were discussed, including the passive vs. active management debate, the country\u2019s high debt-to-GDP ratio, the Dodd\u2013Frank Act , central banks and fixed income markets\u2019 impact on stocks, artificial intelligence, cyclical stocks and high-frequency trading.\nAn element Mr. Buffett couldn\u2019t stress enough was that surrounding yourself with people you admire pillars success. My favourite quote from the event? \u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice what you do have and do need for what you don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.\u201d\nVibrant, intelligent, wise and funny are some of the many words I would use to describe Mr. Buffett. I am extremely grateful to the program and Concordia for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.\nEstablished through a donation by Kenneth Woods, the KWPMP provides a select group of undergraduate JMSB students with hands-on training in investment management by working with a real-life portfolio of over $2 million.\n", "field": "quotes"},

Great networking\nQueer Homecoming is a wonderful way to reconnect and network with other LGBTQ alumni and allies. It is also a unique opportunity for intergenerational dialogue between older LGBTQ pioneers and today\u2019s trailblazing queer youth, and to celebrate Concordia\u2019s rich LGBTQ history.\n2. Concordia\u2019s president\nQueer Homecoming is an opportunity to raise a glass with Concordia President Alan Shepard, who warmly greeted attendees last year. Shepard is very supportive of LGBTQ rights and queer student life on campus.\n3. Fascinating guest speakers\nConcordia has proud LGBTQ alumni working in the public sector, arts, academia and business. Many will be in attendance at Queer Homecoming.\nOne of this year\u2019s guest speakers is Florence Gagnon , BFA 11, publisher of Lez Spread the Word .\nIn a recent Concordia interview, Gagnon said , \u201cThere are currently only three or four major lesbian magazines in the world, and Lez Spread the Word is one of them. It was important for us to create an archive of lesbian culture for future generations, which is one of the reasons we turned to print. The web is so ephemeral, and we wanted to create something more tangible.\u201d\nAnother 2018 Queer Homecoming guest speaker is neuroscientist\u00a0 Robert-Paul Juster , BA 06, currently assistant research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Addiction at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nBefore completing his appointment as Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in 2018, Juster conducted studies researching chronic stress in LGBTQ populations, including Stonewall veterans.\n\u201cMy research shows how coming out of the closet actually garners health benefits that make the LGBTQ community a bit more resilient than mainstream society,\u201d he told Concordia in 2017.\nAt Queer Homecoming, Juster will share his thoughts on the benefits of coming out.\n4. \u00a0Raffle prizes\nTo complete this memorable evening, OUTtv is providing some swag \u2014 including a one-year subscription and a RuPaul backpack \u2014 to be raffled off.\nAll attendees will receive a complimentary one-month subscription to OUTtv.\n5. A friendly evening out\nMore than anything, Queer Homecoming is a relaxed evening where attendees can make new friends, renew old friendships \u2014 and enjoy a chilled glass of white wine!\nConcordia\u2019s Queer Homecoming will be held September 20, 2018, from 6 to 8\u00a0p.m., at the Concordia Conference Centre, John Molson Building, 9th floor, 1450 Guy St., Montreal.\n", "field": "quotes"},

Born in Greece and trained in Paris and Israel, he considers himself an expressionist. He has built his international reputation on his striking paintings but was inspired to work in glass for this particular space.\nArtwork Location\nCampus: Sir George Williams (Quartier Concordia)\nLocation: MB/EV Tunnel, John Molson School of Business\nAddress: 1450 Guy\n", "field": "quotes"},
