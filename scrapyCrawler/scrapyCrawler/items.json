A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees.\nDISC \u2013 discontinue \u2013 The DISC date is later in the term. A withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course.\nNot attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade.\nIf you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite.\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term.\nIf you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared.\nFor additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.\n\u00a0 \u00a0NAVIGATION:\u00a0 Academics > Enroll\u00a0> Drop\nNOTE: If you receive an error message stating \u201cYou are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time\u201d when you click on the Drop tab, you will need to click the \u201cchange term\u201d button and then follow the steps below.\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table.\nClick the Continue button.\nAll registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections.\nSelect the class(es) you want to drop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you are able to drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so.\nSelect the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C \u2014 Swapping classes (including Section changes)\nYou can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available.\u00a0\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course.\nThere are some restrictions attached to swapping classes:\nIf you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold.\nClasses can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term.\u00a0\nFor additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page.\nIf you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes.\nTo swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes.\n\u00a0 \u00a0NAVIGATION:\u00a0 Academics > Enroll\u00a0> Swap\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table.\nClick the Continue button.\nThe first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled.\nThe next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it.\nSelect the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid.\nSelect the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid.\nIf you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the \u201cselect class\u201d button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page.\nIf you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page.\nIf you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page.\nConfirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button.\nIf the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar:\nView My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction:\nSwapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components)\nSearch for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled.\nConfirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed.\nVerify the swap transaction.\nView My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration.\nPLEASE NOTE \u2013 If you try to swap one of your components for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist.\nFor example:\nYou are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0D \u2014 Wait listing classes\nOnce all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list.
